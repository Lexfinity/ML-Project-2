3,"Moving Ostwald borders back to the pre 1967 borders and declaring Palestinian statehood would remove the base for Hamas. Palestinians support Hamas because they're living in an occupied state, IDF are terrorists and they are known to randomly terrorize innocent civilians, invade their homes and steal their property. If the occupation was over, Palestine got their land back and they were now a recognized state Hamas would become irrelevant.

The argument that if they achieved statehood, they would get weapons and attack Israel is not only complete speculation, it's fairly irrelevant. It's like saying that we have to support a bully and help them keep this kid in a locker because if he gets out he might hit the bully, sometimes the right thing to do involves risk and Palestine getting better weapons to attack Israel ok a equal footing for the first time in 60 Years is a risk we have to take.

On Syria, he's been itching to give his buddy Putin a deliverable and wash his hands of it.  He launched a nothing strike on an air field because he wanted good press.

Trump doesn't have beliefs or doctrines about foreign policy beyond ""I have a huge dick look at me,"" and doesn't give a shit about the lives and deaths of people who aren't Trump.

The British's records on Hess are sealed until 2045.  An interesting older book from the 70's 'The Murder of Rudolph Hess' has some curious older loose ends that were never followed up upon by later disclosure efforts.

Documents that the Clinton administration began releasing through the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure act were also mostly Hess-less on the big issues.  

I would buy that the Anglo-American alliance were more than happy to cover up the collusion of a faction of the nobility who were sympathetic to Hitler.  However that does not explain the Soviet's near maniacal obsession with keeping Hess under lock and key after they had let loose so many men who were responsible for the destruction of Russia.

I also think they need to take a look at the underlying mechanics that are causing our stats to increase at such a rapic pace. They number-squished us at the end of MoP because people were doing like 500-600k DPS at the end of the expansion, and it only took us about 3 raid tiers to get back to those DPS levels. If you compare the DPS you'd pull at the start of the expansion, in full heroic dungeon gear, to the DPS you'd pull at the end, when you're in full raid gear, I think our DPS will have increased by something like 1500% to 2000%.

I've read this passage before and tried to interpret its symbology, but it does make some sense for me in this context.

In the first verse it talks about a solar eclipse that reveals our solar system to us with twelve planets (here called stars). The child our sun was about to give birth to was consciousness or life on Earth (potentially by ""deciding"" to create the right conditions for it, where it previously may have nurtured Mars before abandoning that experiment). 

The red dragon that comes in shortly (?) after this particular solar eclipse is Nemesis, bringing along its own planets, moons and other bodies, and potentially entities, and a third of our 12 planets are gravitationally deflected towards Earth and the inner solar system, wreaking havoc, and nearly extinguishing life on Earth.

All this seems to be describing a very distant past to me, but at the same time indicating that this kind of event is cyclical. Do you get the same sense of it?

There's a few holes in that interpretation though. What do you think that passage is describing? The past, the future, both?",conspiracy

When we tried in the same building in March/April, the lowest rent was $2000. It was gone the same day. We tried multiple times where the rent crept up slowly - $2100, $2150, $2200.

463,"&gt; ROFL wow. because lynch ordering comey to stand down, with orders to call it a ""matter"" instead of an investigation, and refusing to ""fall on his sword"", isn't collusion? he stood by and did jack. collusion/obstruction confirmed. unless you want to call comey a liar, in which case he deserves prison time for lying under oath. whichever the case, trump wins. LoL at you.

Do you know what collusion means? are you just trying to use the big bad words the media is using against trump? Saying to call it a matter is not an order to stand down, and if you had actually watched his testimony in which he said that, he said she didn't interfere with his investigation but he came forward with his findings because he didn't want the appearance of impropriety casting doubt on the decision to not prosecute, because the investigation was already finished before the tarmac meeting even happened. So you want to just take comey at his word when it benefits you but ignore the rest?

If rice committed unmasking crimes, where are the charges? You're drinking the kool aid too deep man, this is going to be a very frustrating 4 years for you where you have to keep moving the goalposts to explain why trump has never been wrong about anything ever.

edit: apparently I was wrong, the lawyer was let in by lynch for the trial in febuary, but by the time of the meeting she was just on a normal visa:

Sidney Crosby’s second contract represented not only a higher percentage of the cap at that time it was signed, 17.3 per cent, but McDavid’s deal is also for eight years, not five years, the term of Crosby’s second contract. Because the term of McDavid’s contract is so long the Oilers will be in an increasingly competitive position as McDavid advances through his prime hockey seasons. If the cap rises in conservative fashion at the same rate of 2.82 per cent as it has in the last three seasons, McDavid’s contract will take up 16.21 per cent of the cap in its first year, but just 13.34 per cent in its final year 2026-27. If the cap rises in far more bullish fashion but as its done since it first came into being in 2005-06 (at an average annual rate of 5.76 per cent per year), McDavid’s contract will be 15.77 per cent of the Oilers cap in 2018-19 and just 10.72 per cent of the cap in 2026-27.",hockey

660,"Probably a good thing, but not the only step in solving the problem.  As the article says:

&gt;As for aboriginals, it would make far more sense to invest federal dollars in improving their education, rather than simply hiring them into government jobs for which they aren’t truly qualified. The same is true for blacks and other minority groups that skew toward the low end of the socioeconomic spectrum: Affirmative action merely addresses the symptoms of the problem, not the cause.

Eliminating affirmative action practices is only one half of the right move.  The other half is to follow through and start addressing the real problem, of continuing cultural and educational disparities.

Now imagine someone talking about a  cities jewish character,  and then simeone claiming jews are racist and posting a mish mash of verses from the Hebrew bible.  

Mohammed doesn't  call jews greedy at all.  Instead the Quran tells a story about some jews who broke the sabbath.  In fact its one of the verses you quoted:

&gt;2:65 And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! 2:66 And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and an admonition to the God-fearing.

So its not a blanket claim made against all jews,  but instead particular jews. Thats why its important to know the context of the verses you paste. 

 There were some who attacked Muhammad's s wife for being jewish. He told her to answer them with this:

753,"&gt; One is chivalry, the other is entitlement.

They are one and the same. You cannot sell men on the concept that self-sacrifice is worth something, worthy of praise, worthy of talk like 'hero' and not have a percentage of your population think that what it's worth is ... sex ... or a relationship.  If it has value, why can't I trade it?

&gt; When you hold the door for a woman, or offer her your seat, you aren't doing it because that stranger is going to totally suck your dick in return for it. You do it because you are chivalrous.

Good lord, is the only motivator in your world sex?  People do things for social validation and attention and positive feedback all the time. They do it because it reliably gets them praise and positive feedback from women.

And, in the end, it does have enough value to factor into attraction.  We've known for decades that you can positively incline someone to you by indicating you find them attractive.  The very fact you find THEM attractive, leans them to finding you attractive in return.

It's just part of a constellation of factors and behaviours that *could* result in success. It's not like 'He's such a nice guy' hasn't been uttered a zillion times by a zillion dreamy eyed girls describing some dude they are hot on, right? It's not like dating tips in male magazines talk about how you treat your server is an indicator of how you'll treat her, right?

&gt; The only place I really see the ""Nice Guy"" conception of how relationships work played out is in terrible Romantic Comedies.

Then you need to read more history, because it's everywhere.  Medieval Courtly Love? That's the epitome of sexless self sacrifice for a woman, and it's nearly 1000 years old as a concept. It's precisely where we get that notion of chivalry we're talking about. Cheval or Horse is the root word.  Courtly love became a middle age addition to the code of conduct for mounted knights.

830,"&gt;that would cost metric shittons of money

No doubt. But apparently much poorer ISPs can afford that.

&gt;costs depending on the end points are not transparent

But they can be inferred from the ways similar services and bandwidth scales are handled in different locations. In this case you have a country where infrastructure is arguably costlier to lay down and maintain, yet the quality of service ends up much higher for much lower prices. It doesn't make the costs transparent but it does suggest that there's a fundamental difference in how those services are offered, which is what I'm asking about - what's the difference?

&gt;""where young people in the know stream a lot and there are 10 facebook/vkontakte nooblets for every one of them subsidizing their ass"" is more like it.

Both streaming AND torrenting are not something done by people ""in the know"" - they're commonplace things pretty much every internet user will do from schoolkids to housewives. I understand that you think Americans simply stream more which puts a higher load on the infrastructure but really, where's the evidence for that? 

&gt;Netflix for the masses

You do realize that regardless of context, country, age, user expertise and whatever, a streaming service that requires one to subscribe and set up payments will always be less ""for the masses"" than any streaming service where all that's required to view something is a couple clicks? The amount of websites that stream high quality video for free is exactly why everybody and their grandma streams so much in a country like Russia where computer savviness is not widespread.",worldnews

The problem is there are people who will always complain about *something* when they think they're losing, and sometimes in a toxic way. That is a separate issue.

You are right that the pro meta is not applicable to everyone, all the time. Pro teams can divide up roles, while sometimes you and I might have to do what we can with 5 dps mains and a symmetra OTP. That said, counter-picks are relevant at almost every skill level. A gold reaper will counter a gold winston just as easily as a gm reaper counters a gm winston. One reason why dive comp is so prevalent is that the only counter strategy is...dive comp. Niche or off-meta heroes usually have limited or poor match-ups against the rest of the cast. Mei, torb, bastion, junkrat, et. al. do have their uses in certain maps and situations, but usually playing off-meta actually takes *more* coordination and skill in order to minimize their weaknesses.

Sorry for the long reply. Ultimately, I agree people are a little stubborn about the meta, but I think it's fine and effective to try to emulate the pros in most situations. ",

u/TheLoneExplorer, really, assuming what you typed were exact quotes, there's potential that you replying to 'Him' in that manner could've been what really shut down any chance of him actually putting effort in and not giving up. Granted, I wasn't there and thus I don't fully get the situation in its entirety, and from what you've detailed the chances were slim-to-none that he'd change his mind regardless, but I could just imagine a person like 'Him' hearing what you said and just shoving it off as nonsense because of the way you said it. But, if you had addressed him in a different way, with different words, you could've maybe changed his mind. 

I've dealt with people like this before countless times. People can so be so quick to just say, 'give them the objective,' 'we've already lost,' etc., and I'm usually the one to get their asses in line and tell them that you really shouldn't be saying 'it's over' until it's actually over. Most of the time they actually hush up and stop spouting all that 'might as well give up' stuff. I think it's due to the way I say it.

934,"I used to have a really serious self harm problem, would usually cut/burn myself every day (depression and isolation, you know?). One day I was feeling particularly bad so I was in a bit of an extended ""session."" About 45 minutes in I was getting absolutely none of the relief I was used to, and I was starting to run out of space (usually I would only do stuff to my upper thighs, where my boxers would always be covering everything so no one would know). I started to get extremely frustrated and angry, both with my inability to feel better, and with myself in general.

So, I decided that since I was out of thigh space (couldn't grab my legs to position the knife/skin without grabbing another cut), and I didn't seem to be cutting hard enough, I'd do one last big one on my shoulder and be done for the night. 

The knife I was using was serrated at the part of the blade near the handle, and straight towards the end. I'd mostly been using just a little bit of the serration, just to get things started, but for the shoulder cut I decided to use the full serrated portion. I was really worked up and instead of just a sort of passive cut, I dug the serration in to the rear area of my shoulder and then ripped it forward with way more force than I normally would.

As soon as I did it I knew I'd fucked up. The flesh on my arm just sort of *dropped* like a quarter inch from where the cut opened up all the way across. That pulled the cut open and I realized I could see into it sideways, with all the fat and muscle. I don't know how to describe the feeling exactly, except that it was a similar kind of ""oh shit"" you feel when you look over the edge of something really tall and then lean out a little to far, so you lose balance and for a second you think you're gonna fall, except it lasted like a minute and a half instead of just a few seconds. Like the bottoms of my feet hurt and everything.

It started bleeding like crazy after that and I started to panic, thinking I was gonna bleed out, and since it was 3 am in an isolated area it was going to take a while to get help and get to the hospital. Fortunately a friend was able to get me some help, but by the time I was almost to the hospital I started getting really woozy and realized I couldn't really close either hand into a fist because I had lost too much blood. That was the second sort of bone chilling ""oh shit."" Fortunately the police officer I was riding with was a lot more experienced than me and told me not to worry about it, if I was still conscious I was fine. Sounds weird but it made me feel a lot better. 

Anyway, got patched up at the hospital, nearly got institutionalized but the officer I was with talked them out of it. Haven't really cut since because that really bone chilling ""oh fuck I might die"" has really stuck with me.",

991,"There is the 100th monkey effect, which could conceivably explain how one society started doing things in a specific way (like building pyramids for a specific reason), and then disconnected cultures in other places starting to have the same idea. 

I'd argue, however, that the structures are so similar and so widespread across so many areas and cultures, that I find it more reasonable to believe that it was a much more uniform and connected culture who built them long before the first cultures we have other records of, like the sumer Ian's or Egyptians. 

The timeline of the demise of this ancient, prehistoric culture, according to Graham Hancock would be closer to 12500 years ago, as his research indicates that all those megalithic structures and temples (not just the pyramids) point to cosmic circumstances that last occurred ca. 10500BC.

And if you think that our cities would still be there 10000 years from now if we just up and left today, then you're underestimating the power of erosion.

Most surviving ancient structures were either strongly eroded (sphinx, pyramids) or preserved, used and maintained by indigenous peoples of the epochs that came since.

If you haven't read him yet or watched his documentaries, Hancock really does present a very good argument for an advanced predeluvian society that virtually vanished some 12500 years ago.",conspiracy

1002,"&gt; Have you read the article? Politically talking, only those tho pacted with independentists parties, which is way different than ""having doubts"". All the rest were kicked for causing trouble, for example with the justice.

Good lord the lies. Compromis is not an independentist party in any of the infinite parallel universes that may exist. Good god. And, even if they were independentists, so what? What's with this ad hominem? You can't pact policies just because of the name of the party you're voting them with? That's pretty... stupid.

&gt; Again, read the article. He left the party because of the insults that he was receiving from the rest of the PP group for going against them. They didn't kick him.

This is WAY worse* than simply being kicked by your political opinion. I see you prefer being harassed, bullied, and forced to resign (very fascist-like,uh?), than just being kicked. Ok.

&gt; Obviously, one guy wants to declare ""non-grata"" to the 2-3rd most important person of the party, what would you expect?

""Obviously, one minister casts a shadow of doubt on the possibility of doing a referendum, despite that being the thing promised over and over again. What do you expect?""

If it's any of the Spanish parties (bar Podemos, I can expect from you)--&gt; ""What do you expect?"".

And inb4, yes. Both cases are comparable in the very essence of the problem, which is lack of internal freedom of speech. If you condemn one, you must condemn the other.

&gt; Once more, read the article. They kicked them for voting against what they previously pacted. Way different than kick them for having a different opinion.

This is a similar case as the one previously discussed: freedom of speech. Anyway, have this http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/01/05/586ebb2a46163fce078b4575.html

&gt; The Catalan government is the perfect example of modern fascism. They have a problem with the people who think differently. Firstly they cut the subsidies to that media that don't support them, and now they kick people who ""have doubts"" about their policies.

Just go fuck yourself. Are you forgetting that we want to do a rewferendum so all parts involved have a say? That the ones suppressing the opinion of 80% of Catalan society are the Spanish institutions? I've literally fucking linked you an example for each of the traditional parties in which members who differ from the ideology are kicked, yet only the Catalan government is ""modern fascist"".

You can either go to a sporting goods store and pick up a cheap practice ball for 10-15 dollars, or just something roundish, and you can play 1v1, juggle by yourself, play 2v2 or any number you want as high as you would like to go. With baseball, mitts aren't particularly cheap. And if you actually hit balls instead of just playing catch, you'll mess up the ball somewhat quickly.

I still do go around and play baseball and catch as much as I can, but it's much easier to play a game that doesn't use a mitt, and doesn't need any equipment outside of the ball. And it is why the games that require more initial money, like tennis or lacrosse tend to be dominated by players with upper middle class and upper class families. Sure, you can go out and toss a ball back and forth, but if you want to actually practice to be able to play in the majors or even at a college level, you need equipment. With other sports, you can become skilled enough to be competitive without needing a bunch of other players and with very little cost to yourself. Growing up, I had to rely on friends who had enough money for bats, as I had a mitt and not enough money for other stuff. In many communities, there isn't anyone who has enough for a bat, and lots don't have enough for a mitt, so there's no way that you are going to get a league with players there. It's just a problem that certain sports have.",baseball

1034,"&gt; Crimean war + russo-turkish war alone account for close to half a million dead.

1) The crimean war happened 50 years before the census. Around 40k Ottomans were killed.

2) The Russo Turkish war happened 30 years before the census. Around 120k Ottomans were killed.

3) There's no evidence that those people came from Istanbul. There's also no evidence of how many refugees came from Bulgaria to artificially and temporily increase Istanbul's muslim population. There's no evidence how many Bulgarians were killed or expelled from the city during the second war.

&gt; Tens of thousands in the Greek rebellion, tens of thousands in the Montenegrin wars.

No evidence they came from Istanbul. The same isn't true for the Christians. During the Greek rebellion that ffs happened almost 80 years before the census, the Greek population of Istanbul was decimated by the Turks during one of the many pogroms in the city's history.

&gt;  No period I know of except the Balkan wars + ww1 comes close.

The period between 1400-1600 the Ottomans agressively invaded any land they came in contact with nonstop. The second half of the 19th century is actually one of the most peaceful periods.

1050,"&gt;he was hired with the understanding that he would do X work for Y pay per week using the original techniques he started with.

This is simply not true, at least for the vast majority of skilled (or even semi-skilled) positions in the modern Western workplace.  In fact, it is the *whole point* of hourly positions; you are hired to do the best job you can keep up for 40 hours each week (or a reasonable approximation thereof).

You are hired for your skillset; the idea is that you will become more efficient and more valuable the longer you spend in the job.  You are talking some serious manual labor/menial task bullshit jobs if you have in mind something where a company says ""we are going to hire you in the hopes that you will produce x documents per day, forever"".

I have stepped into positions with backlogs and four-week lead times, and turned them into one-day turnarounds.  But that is the point; I sold myself, in my interview and otherwise, as someone who could improve the existing system.  

If you go into an interview and tell your prospective boss ""honestly, I am going to accomplish the bare minimum of what you lay out for me as mandatory, and that's it"", and he is cool with that, awesome!  But how often does that happen?  If you go into an interview talking about what a quick learner you are, and how much you can improve the existing outlook, you have no justification for sitting on your ass because you are 'accomplishing enough' in two hours each day.

Edit: Annnd of course, I am being downvoted by all of the folks who are trying desperately to convince themselves that spending most of their workday on reddit is morally acceptable, and that in fact their bosses should promote them if they discover it for being *so* talented.",

There are a TON of flaws in Signs, but I'm willing to overlook damn near all of them because I enjoy the characters, I enjoy the plot, I think the film has great build/tension/suspense even after I've seen it countless times. I love the farm house setting. I love that you never really see the Aliens. I love that ridiculous 'found footage' of that random Birthday party in Brazil where we finally get a glimpse of one of the beings, just for a moment. I think that Mel &amp; Joaquin Phoenix do an amazing job. I absolutely LOVE the 'Swing, Merill' subplot with the wife and how it plays into the climax. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, Zack Snyder probably got the idea for ""Martha"" in BvS from Signs, but when Merill pulls his record setting baseball bat off of the wall mount and gets to wrecking those Aliens, I cheer every time. I like the kid actors, too. Yes, A LOT of the dialogue in the film is so dumb. And yes, those aliens must've had a death wish coming to a planet 3/4's water. I hope those poor fools didn't touch down in the Southeast! The humidity and the moisture in the air down here would've taken off the top layers of their skin upon arrival!!! I detest the female cop character and I think M. Night's cameo is one of the most shoehorned in cinema history! But there are VERY FEW movies that just never seem to get old for me, and Signs is one of them. 

 Also, I would like to mention that The Happening is one of the best comedies I've ever seen (Along with that piss poor Body Snatchers remake with Daniel Craig &amp; Nicole Kidman) -- Both of those movies have scenes designed to be hauntingly terrifying, and they make me laugh EVERY time I see them. The scene in The Happening where this guy lays down on his stomach, in the grass, and then proceeds to just lay still in the same spot for several minutes while a gigantic industrial lawnmower runs over him. Obviously it is meant to evoke terror and fright, but instead, it is almost a frame for frame rehash of the runover death gag in the Austin Powers series, the only difference being that the guy about to get run over doesn't scream for 10 minutes while Austin tells him to move. No. In The Happening, the guy just lays down and accepts that in about 2 hours, he will be run over!!!!! To this day, I don't know how or why M. Night thought that 'the wind' causing people to off themselves could ever be scary. But as a comedy? Unrivaled. ",movies

1154,"Well couple of things 1.Most of anime are played in Japan TV series so you won't see 98% of anime if you do not not stream it or download through torrent.
2. The ""creators"" of anime are not loosing if you stream anime or download it through torrent, they're not taking any damage. In fact you more like helping them out increassing fanbase etc.
3. It's some kinda stupid for me to say it's illegal becasue you are not doing anything wrong, it's just the law for me that it's so stupid. The reason for that cos many people watching TV series, watch it with adverts etc. that directly help the ""creators"" by streaming or downloading it you are kind of not attach to that and here lays the wholl stupid law stuff etc. and you are not living in Japan so you won't see adverts and watch their TV by iincreasing views, do you?
4.In my opinion feel free to download anime etc. As I said before you are more helping the ""creators"" then actually damaging it. However it's wrong to download movies etc. that are on blu rays if you have spare money you should buy them, they're like normal films and same idea of copyright follows them.

The reason you are being downvoted is because that argument is one of a discriminatory position. Homosexuality isn't just ""sleeping with [insert sex],"" it is being sexually attracted to someone of the same sex. That is something out an individual's control, like skin color. Your argument fails to include this, and while it is true that you choose who to sleep with, you are implying that gay people shouldn't not necessarily have the right to sleep with the partners that they choose without facing discrimination. That was the comparison being made in the analogy, as according to the original premise, people should be able to be both black and gay without being discriminated against. Being gay would presumably include not just attraction, but actual engagement in sexual activity of the desired sex, or, as you put it, ""sleeping with men."" ",baseball

- extended VR with VR-Glasses and some cage you can strap yourself in for exercising gaming? ok, no probs

- chip in brain? maybe for people 18+, not going to be ""mandatory"" in the next 20 years thanks to ethics

1365,"My mom does this. From my empirical knowledge, I have concluded that it is more of a power struggle between her and my dad. My mom wants to be in control because her mother was a crappy parent who didn't pay any attention to her kids and would marry men just for the financial support alone. Long Story short, my mom pretty much raised her brother and sister, so naturally she is used to being in control and the instant someone who actually is in control comes into play, she snatches away the power similar to how Michael Scott stole the power from the captain of the ship in [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqxwH8NOHJ8) episode of the office. When in reality, something seems as small as just a toilet seat being left up, which should never piss anyone off in the first place, my mom will turn it in to an upscale argument to make herself the alpha of the group.

 I have found that the only way she feels comfortable is if she is in charge. For example, she is the kind of person who will be insulted if you do not take her advice, and will say the same thing to you until either (a) you tell her to fuck off, or (b) you accept what she has to say, and incorporate it slightly into how you originally planned it out. She is the kind of customer that will yell at the cashier for something they aren't in control of (i.e. a discount that requires supervisor approval but the supervisor can't get there very quickly so the customer gets all butt hurt that it takes 5 extra minutes. I am a cashier, so I can easily identify what type of people will likely have different reactions towards things.) 

She needs everything organized and planned out in order to be comfortable in a program or event. An interesting story about this is my Eagle Scout project was building a fence. She practically took control of the planning and the organization because she was afraid I would not be able to succeed. Because of this, I did not know my plan very well and had to meet with the board 5 times to get it approved. The sad thing is, I did not realize until after I was awarded it that I felt I didn't deserve it and quit Boy Scouts immediately from shame. In my troop, there were huge arguments about how I did not deserve being Eagle because of how my mom did most of the work. (I was 13 and 14 at the time). 

 She will compete with her friends over whose children are succeeding most ( which is always my brother, a Math/Physics major with a 4.0 at a major UC) but will stretch the truth to always come out as the winner. She is the kind of person that will interrupt someone in a 3 or more person conversation if something comes into her mind, which really used to piss me off as a child as I had trouble with getting friends in middle school so I never felt like my opinions were heard.

Now this may seem like some rant about how my mom is a crazy attention-whoring bitch. Truth is, I love her dearly and am glad she is the way she is as many good things have come from her forceful attitude, like me being forced to go to a private school, which I despised the choice at first, but immediately was happy I was allowwed to go.

Another interesting thing is how her control over me growing up mixed with my dad's passive aggressiveness made me end up without guidance and needed some form of control in my life or else I end up like bachelor frog. Because of this, (which I realize after they happenned) all of my relationships have been with people who are independent, strong-willed, and controlling. Controlling as in they make plans and control plans, but not over who I see or what I do.

Sorry if this was really irrellevent, but reading your comment made me start this whole internal thought of why the toilet seat up pisses my mom off.

1443,"Another interesting part:
&gt;116.
&gt;The Venice Commission indeed regularly recommends establishing mechanisms which help to ensure a balanced composition of constitutional courts.29 In its 1997 Report, **the Commission explained what it means by pluralism**: “Constitutional justice must, by its composition, guarantee independence with regard to different interest groups and contribute towards the establishment of a body of jurisprudence which is mindful of this pluralism.” **Here, the emphasis is on the independence of the judges and their respect for pluralism, not their “representation” of party interests.**
&gt;117.
&gt;In Poland, the governmental majority argues that the current opposition had time during two terms of the Sejm to nominate judges at its will. As a consequence, most judges at the Constitutional Tribunal are seen to be “opposition judges”. According to this logic, the principle of pluralism was violated because the outgoing majority wanted to occupy 14 out of the 15 seats at the Constitutional Tribunal.
&gt;118.
&gt;This view of the Constitutional Tribunal with judges “belonging” to one party and other judges “belonging” to the other party seems to equate the Tribunal with another chamber of Parliament. This was strikingly visible when the judges were marked in a particular colour in the charts presented to the Venice Commission delegation as if they were a group in Parliament. The Venice Commission **cannot subscribe to such an approach** and it has difficulty understanding the aim of establishing “pluralism” in the Constitutional Tribunal **if this just means appointing a sufficient number of one’s own “representatives” to the Tribunal**. This logic seems to assume that a lack of such party pluralism is legally relevant, but there is no constitutional basis for such a concept.
&gt;119.
&gt;While Members of Parliament legitimately represent the ideas of political parties, this is very different from the role of constitutional court judges. Constitutional judges have a “duty of ingratitude” towards the authority that elected or appointed them. **They may well be nominated by a party and elected by the MPs of that same party, but they can never represent that party. As judges, they are independent, their loyalty is to the Constitution, not to those who have elected them.**

&gt; 29 years old French musician Worakls is one of these artists whose music is organic. Stemming from musicians' family, he learns the piano from the age of 3 years. Having studied to the academy, its knowledge goes beyond the electronics, and allows him to create compositions which can’t be defined by a style.

&gt; His music is powerful, dreamlike and sophisticated. It draws its strength from the synthesis of a multitude of kinds and periods. As if Mozart and Rolling Stones had been made an appointment some years later...

&gt; Before even the release of his first album, Worakls has already begun a world tour with gigs on famous festivals as “La Nuit Rouge” in France or “Soultech Festival” in Mexico, but also in clubs which make live the passion of the techno around the globe!

&gt; To play in front of 10.000 or 600 persons has no importance for him, as long as good energy gets free of each performance.

&gt; His productions find their place in the charts of the ""best sales"" every week, and are playlisted every weekend all around the globe. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; David Warren Brubeck (born December 6, 1920 in Concord, California - December 5, 2012) was an American jazz pianist who has written a number of jazz standards, including ""In Your Own Sweet Way"" and ""The Duke"". He was probably best known for ""Take Five"", written by saxophone player Paul Desmond, who was the saxophonist in The Dave Brubeck Quartet. Due to the immense popularity of his work, Brubeck had won multiple awards such as a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys in 1996, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship in 1999, and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2009.

&gt; Brubeck's style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting his mother's attempts at classical training and his improvisational skills. Much of his music employed unusual time signatures, a fact jokingly referred to by his greatest hits album 'Time Signatures: A Career Retrospective'. Upon his death, a number of commentators noted his crossover appeal to mainstream pop audiences, something putting him in the company of other jazz legends such as Louis Armstrong and Herbie Hancock among others.

1501,"The Spanish Inquisition had two purposes: Originally, to check whether the Jewish conversos were truly converted rather than faking it, and after the Protestant reform, to stamp any and all protestant heresy. Witches were an afterthought, because many inquisitors did not believe in witchcraft.

The Basque country (the area in red) was the biggest ""witchcraft"" prosecution hotspot, apparently because in the French basque country they loved burning their witches.

But after Spain's biggest and most famous witchcraft case, the Witches of Zugarraurdi, where two fanatical inquisitors accused  hundreds of people and killed 11 witches, several inquisitors complained to the Supreme Council of the Inquisition about the trials (including one fo the judges, who disagreed with the sentence) the Inqusition ordered a full investigation (they asked that judge who had disagreed, the inquisitor Alonso de Salazar y Frías).

Alonso spent several months examining the area, and his conclusion was that all the accusations had been false, due to torture or revenge against disliked neighbours. Furthermore, he said than every confession related to magic was ridiculous, the magic potions did not work (and many had been invented in the spot by random accused persons, under threat of the inquisitors), and that upon medical examination, the women who claimed to have sex with the devil were still virgins.

He decided that it was actually the priests sermons the ones who created the witchcraft hysteria, and in most areas there had never been signs of witches until the town priest began preaching against them. 

Another humanist, Pedro de Valencia, in a study asked by the Inquisitor General, stated that self-proclaimed witches weren't heretics, but mentally ill people, so instead of treating them with religious prosecution, they should be cured of their madness. (cured by beating them with sticks. Because enlightened 17th century inquisitor still is 17th century inquisitor)

You go out too hard, you start the sprint to the finish too early, you die hard near the end and it looks ugly, especially when you get caught from behind by someone who did pace themselves perfectly.  

I saw a team that had never been to an SB(which so many coaches and players compare the day itself to a marathon), fail to pace themselves, blow their load early, die at the end, and get caught from behind. ATL didn't choke. They didn't have any silly turnovers. They got tired mentally and physically, they slowed down, became very manageable for the Pats, and they made bad decisions late. Even Matt Ryan and Quinn were saying how completely gassed they all were by the end.

The only thing resembling choking was the coaches inability to read the flow of the game shifting (not that I did either) and failed to adjust the gameplan on the fly accordingly. 

The Seahawks choked. They had a hiccup at the worst possible time. But they recovered afterwards, which was why they came here last year and beat us. They never broke, despite what ESPN would have you believe.

Old talent trees are similar to Artifact weapons in the fact that you put points into it and unlock paths. Beyond that, they are completely different, and do not really compare.

And 99% of Europeans are polite and warm? I've found that there are all kinds of personalities in Europe, even within cultures and countries. French, especially Parisians, are not always warm and can be gruff -- they'll respond nicely to courtesy, and they'll warm up to you, but Parisians are like New Yorkers as they live in a dense city that they see as a cultural center. They are very different in attitude from French who live in places with slower lifestyles, and their reputation is well earned. 

And Europeans are often rough. Even Europeans in resort destinations complain about German tourists. Drunken English weekenders are occasionally a fucking nightmare. And, yes, the French can be... stereotypically French. I've spent months at a time in each place (plus Italy and Belgium) working with the locals. And I've truly met all kinds.

Everyone starts off as female because one X chromosome is all that's needed for this; a functional, *bound* Y chromosome is what makes embryos develop into males, it's an androgen. But there are XY people whose Y doesn't bind and so isn't ""read"" like other chromosomes should be. So their body just reads 1 X and assumes a female. Biologically, these people are women, no 2 ways about it. They can't have kids because this requires a pair of sex chromosomes to split with a partners, and Curtis' kids being adopted fuelled this rumour I think. Anyway, this is all an unconfirmed rumour about JLC, the condition is real though. I *think* it's androgen insensitivity syndrome but don't quote me on that",

The EU has more trade available to liberalise, larger population and better negotiators so it's far easier to get larger economies to come to the table in the first place. It's important to remember that most nations are much more protectionist than the UK, so to get them to open up their markets in any meaningful way you really need something to offer them. The UK's economy is too dominated by services, and those are the industries that countries like China and India want to safeguard. Just as an example, the deal between China and Switzerland was only signed in order to help Swiss goods exports. IT, business consulting, advertising, Swiss specialities, have all been left as they are.

Someone like kennyS has a legendary feel to him and you're tempted to add him to superteam lists, but the reality is that he is not performing like a outright superstar for a while now and not even performing well tbh looking at Kennys's current inconsistency and impact. Hobbit and AdreN are top tier players right now and AdreN has been touted as one of the best stars in CIS since last year by analysts and hobbit as the up and coming star that still has lots of potential (and if Gambit was in the shuffle, lots of people have them in their CIS dream team, along with Zeus). Regardless of your idea of them, this one-two punch beat the likes of Astralis and big names like dev1ce kjaerbye and xyp9x in a BO3 in the majors. Maybe it's a one time occurrence, but mou stepped the fuck up this major and played like a top 5 awper and demolished dev1ce head-to-head (he was on fire), much better than anything Guardian (another brand name) has shown in the past year. Even Dosia has shown the he still belongs in the scene, most people forget but in early CS GO he was considered one of the best players in the world and the best player of the CIS region. Zeus is the most proven and best IGL in CIS, as Dazed has said recently in one of his ""post major what we learned from the major"" video, good IGL's are worth their weight in gold although they usually don't get the credit or love or attention like the top fragging superstars. Gambit has a excellent core for a team that works beyond the usual ""super team"", literally 3/5 of those guys would be a lock for the ""CIS dream team"" and if they added s1mple for dosia on the team and mou performed like he did in the major, they would literally be one. While in the end, the ""superteam"" G2 looks underwhelming than anything and has to even qualify for the major again because big names and brands that aren't in form or performing are just overrated mediocrity.

Also online doesn't mean shit, everyone in the scene knows this. You know you're grasping for straws when you have to mention online results. Same reason everyone gives teams like VP (and also G2 and tons of other teams) a pass when they're pretty pathetic online, G2 has been splitting series and losing online to tier 2 teams for quite a while now, teams they will not have a chance losing to on lan (and would get shitted on for doing so on lan) but no one blinks an eye cause it's online. People only started giving shit to VP because VP online literally has not given a single fuck to the point where they are getting relegated from their league for their utterly atrocious online performances. Online only matters in terms of qualifying for events such as ESL Pro League Finals and to stay in your league and not get relegated (cough VP) but gambit has barley played in the last 6 months and showed up everytime they did on LAN, and when they did play online (to lose to some tier 3 CIS team) there was literally no stakes and it was for events like pointless kinguin cups that no one gives a shit about besides bettors. Not to mention most of Gambit are playing these online kinguin cups with 150-200 ping from Kazakhstan.",GlobalOffensive
1830,"1. Injustices done to the natives kept happening to around long before the treaties and 'indian act' in around 1870 a few years after canada's forming. The actual real war between whites and natives had been long since done long before this time and the tensions had been over for awhile.

1881,"Here's another interesting fact, by the way. During 1939, the USSR was trying to sign some sort of alliance or treaty with the UK, France and all that kind of stuff. The other side wasted time, didn't want to commit to anything, tried to renegotiate every little detail - in other words, did everything to avoid signing a treaty with the USSR other than directly refusing. The Soviet Union wasn't exactly eager either, often adding more details and trying to redefine some terms of the agreement, so both sides are at fault here, but IIRC the UK was using the delaying tactic to avoid making a commitment while at the same time prevent (by continuing the negotiations) the USSR from reaching any sort of deal with Germany, hoping to wait until late autumn so that Germany wouldn't want to start a winter war.

Finally, in mid-August, it seemed that an agreement was finally reached. A formal treaty was going to be signed to oppose Germany, but there was only one minor detail. The USSR insisted that the treaty specified that in case of German aggression, the Soviet Army would have military access through Poland toward the German borders. And that's what Poland was dead set against. For an entire week the negotiations over this one tiny point continued, with France trying to pressure Poland into acceptance, but the Poles refused.

Meanwhile the Germans swiftly accepted all Soviet demands and signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The USSR told the UK and France that this pact ""in no way prevented them from continuing their negotiations"", but at that point it was obviously too late.

I'm not saying it's Poland's fault, pretty much everyone messed up then, but I can't help thinking that if only Poland agreed to let the Soviet Army through to the German border in case of a war, the USSR would've joined the Allied defensive pact against the Nazi Germany around mid-August and history might have gone completely differently. The agreement wasn't even covering defending Poland specifically, but also Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Romania, the Baltic states, Finland, or ""if any of the signatories got involved in a war by request from a European country"". Basically it would've meant that the USSR would've entered the war in 1939, together with the UK and France, if Germany made a move against pretty much anyone.",europe

It's not bearing false witness if there is a pile of evidence (as there is with #pizzagate and Hillary Clinton, both purposely DEFENDED by that so called ""Christian"" article) that the parties involved are in league with our enemy!

Both Hillary and Pedosta have provided all the evidence you need from their own mouths. Bill Clinton is on record as stating that Hillary [*communes with the spirits of the dead*](https://youtu.be/MRav-34ufcE). An absolutely forbidden practice of necromancy. (in reality you are conversing with lying spirits that KNEW the dead and impersonate them) We as Chrsitians should **SHINE A LIGHT INTO THE DARKNESS** and show these things for what they truly are, which are servants of Satan that occupy the highest levels of government throughout the world.

The only thing I will say about #pizzagate or #pedogate is that if you do not believe in the mountain of evidence that they themselves have provided us with, than you are woefully IGNORANT and BLIND to the truth and have spent little to no time legitimately researching these claims, as is evident by the author who wrote that article. The subjects spoken of are extremely dark, make no mistake. They are also very very real, and we should not underestimate the depravity of our fallen sinful nature in this flesh when combined with spiritual forces of darkness that most people can barely fathom as even being real, let alone full of the malevolent and vile hatred that they are.

That specific article infuriates me to no end, and I can't stand to see it spread around as so called ""christian truth"" when it is full of lies and deceit.

I have no patience for cowards who would stand by idly and not call out the servants of satan for what they truly are while hiding behind the excuse of ""bearing false witness.""

Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. **Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them**.

**The reason** behind the conservatives taking away public funding from other parties is to destroy competition. Canada is being branded as a conservative country and its everyone's money that's helping. Other party's are going to fall off the face of the earth without enough funding. 

You seem to think that people just up and research into each party's platform *they don't.* They listen and watch the ads. some 18% of voters watched the debate. People want to be reached, they don't want to reach the party. The Conservatives will win again if there isn't some really great stunts on behalf of the NDP and Liberals. But it looks grim.",

The only above average 3 point shooter apart from Embiid was Robert Covington, who was injured during much of Embiid's playing time. How can you criticize his assists when his teammates were simply incapable of converting his passes?

KAT without a doubt has the edge over Embiid in fouling, but that's an extremely minor problem. The difference between KAT and Embiid in fouls per 36 is 2.2 2.2 fouls is hardly anything to tip the scales drastically in one players favor.

It does not take its themes or characters lightly.

The incest is a controversial issue but it was handled in a way that goes beyond mere pandering, it raised the legitimate question of what is right or wrong and challenged the characters (in addition to us viewers) to answer it ourselves. This is one of the best shows Ive ever seen at tackling that controversial subject and not pulling punches unlike the thousand of other shows that just settle for teasing (*cough* eromanga sensei *cough*)


From a production standpoint it's has a very attractive aesthetic that's easy on the eyes and has a beautiful OST composed by Manubu Miwa, one of the best strings compositions I've ever heard, totally sells the mood of the show.

And of course, I did watch it for the fanservice too and that was done really well. Every scene was well animated and the music enhanced the emotion. I wish more romances ended with a sex scene, since that's what lovers tend to do.

1983,"Recessions always happen and it won't be long before the next one. A simple search will show hundreds of articles of ""experts"" predicting recessions, particularly in the US which would effect the rest of us greatly. One of many examples http://www.marketwatch.com/story/next-recession-will-hit-during-trumps-first-two-years-2017-05-01 

Recessions (and booms) are as fundamental to capitalism as food-lines are to communism, in that idealist university graduates always pretend that in an ideal world the system can run without that thing happening, but it's a load of bollocks and is completely impossible in the real world. 

We live in a time of large-scale social unrest, both in the developed world and in the ME and Africa. We live in a time where even during economic booms an ever-increasing minority of people do not necessarily see any real growth in their own incomes and also face increased competition from ""outsiders"" who appear to be more successful than them. There's also an increasing perception that the outsiders receive more help from the government. It's a ticking time bomb waiting to happen. 

The problem with a potential recession is that interest rates have nowhere to go so in the event of another credit crunch the government might end up making some stupid decisions in a desperate attempt to correct things, I.E. huge negative interest rates or banking deregulation to get things moving again. Few governments would be able to get away with doing nothing and allowing the markets to re-correct in the event of recession as people are increasingly disenfranchised and distrustful of the government. 

If interest rates become farcical and banks get deregulated again then in another 10-15 years time we could end up with a massive crisis that dwarfs 2008 and 1929 when the deregulated banks go completely tits up.

If our governments don't completely fuck everything up in the next 20 years I will be utterly shocked, because so far they've made good progress on it. There's a chance that things can be reversed but given how terrible politicians have been doing in the last 20 years I'm not too hopeful. Fuck-ups followed by fuck-ups followed by fuck-ups and each successive government finds itself in an increasingly difficult position to mop up the messes because all good faith and trust has already been eroded.

We have known since before the dnc email leak that hackers working for the russian government were responsible. From the washington post:  
  

&gt;In June 2016, The Washington Post reportedthat the Democratic National Committee’s computer network had been hacked, allowing access to email and chat transcripts, as well as files detailing research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

&gt;This was reported about a month before the hacked files were released, shortly before the Democratic convention began. As The Post reported at the time, the likely culprits had already been identified as Russian — not by the government but by an outside firm called CrowdStrike.

&gt;The firm identified two separate hacker groups, both working for the Russian government, that had infiltrated the network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer. The firm had analyzed other breaches by both groups over the past two years.

&gt;One group, which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear, had gained access last summer and was monitoring the DNC’s email and chat communications, Alperovitch said.

&gt;The other, which the firm had named Fancy Bear, broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition research files. It was this breach that set off the alarm. The hackers stole two files, Henry said. And they had access to the computers of the entire research staff — an average of about several dozen on any given day.  
  

&gt;That report was bolstered by other evidence. As the blog Motherboard reported, the additional evidence pointing to Russia includes:  

&gt;Analysis of DNC log files by two CrowdStrike competitors that reached the same conclusion based on the reuse of tools known to be linked to Russian hackers.  
  
&gt;The registration of a domain intended to trick DNC employees that pointed back to an Internet address that had been used in previous hacks.  
  
&gt;The accidental inclusion of Russian-language metadata in some of the leaked files, as well as some error messages that were printed in Russian. In later releases of the same files, those messages were removed.  
  
&gt;The fact that the leaker of the DNC documents, Guccifer 2.0, claimed to be Romanian but didn’t speak that language.    ",worldnews

2001,"&gt;New York can be a hell hole when you are faced with a blood crazed media every day. Aside from a few relatively minor bumps in the road, Jeter has handled that situation with nothing but dignity throughout his career. 

I disagree -- the Yankees get the puffiest of puffy media treatment, and no one has gotten treated with more kid gloves than Jeter.  He's had the benefit of the doubt for 15 years.  And even with that, he's had some pretty silly public dustups over that time which were swept under the rug (refusing to change positions before even being asked; negotiating his contract in public; snubbing A-Rod when he was being booed).

The New York sports media are only abusive and nasty with regard to the other 8 teams that play in New York.  With the Yankees they are like the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette talking about the Pirates, or your local newspaper talking about the high school team; it takes a reeeeeeeally huge scandal or glaringly obvious news story to get them to say anything negative, ever.

Also, just to clarify, this is by no means meant to be an anti-Yankee comment, as there are definitely some guys on that team I have respected over the years (Williams being one, Posada is another) but Jeter is not that guy.  He's certainly not the MOST unprofessional, classless guy in baseball, by a longshot, but he's not the most professional and classiest, either, or anywhere close to it.  He's a big star with a big ego, which is understandable, but let's not rewrite history and make him into a saint.",baseball

2007,"&gt; I wonder if the movie is still going to be taking place in the world of RPA operations.

There's plenty to go off of that has nothing to do with drones/RPA's. In fact, the Navy doesn't do much RPA stuff - most of that stuff in the news is Air Force.

TOPGUN is now a part of NAWDC - Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center - and they teach SFTI's (Strike Fighter Tactics Instructors) as well as develop tactics and employment of strike fighter aircraft in the Navy.

In fact, NAS Fallon is now the shop for Navy strike fighter jets, electronic attack, airborne early warning, and helicopters for tactical training and large force exercises.

2040,"The main reason Genji has a bigger weakness to crowd control is that it takes away his main strength - his mobility and unpredictability. Heroes like Soldier:76 and McCree don't rely on movement as much in their playstyles, so crowd control isn't as devastating as it is for more mobile heroes like Genji, Sombra (Translocator can make her hard to fully take down) or Tracer.    
    
I know there's the whole things to mitigate weaknesses, but Scatter Arrow doesn't so much as mitigate Hanzo's weakness as outright remove it.    
    
I'd say Hanzo's main strength over Widowmaker without Scatter Arrow is the ability to quickdraw high damage shots if needed at close quarters (or quickly firing multiple arrows at close range). Hanzo can still somewhat fight as he flees, while Widowmaker must decide between using the Widow's Kiss' automatic fire to finish off a target, or to use her grapple to flee entirely. She can't do half and half like Hanzo can.    
    
(Pharah's main weakness is a Widowmaker/McCree with good aim. The damage per shot can be pretty devastating. Widowmaker in particular - 120 damage for a bodyshot is the same as Pharah for a direct hit; a fully charged headshot will one shot Pharah completely; and there's no damage falloff at range. You could say that it's harder to play Widowmaker effectively than it is to play Pharah effectively, which is fair enough. Another suggestion would be to avoid being right out in the open - if you try and seclude yourself a little, Pharah will be forced to come closer to you in order to land hits with her rockets. Which will make her more vulnerable to your attacks.)

2125,"&gt; Aw, that's cute, you think you know how much I know, or rather, you just want to make a condescending comment that doesn't help you.

You were the one starting to be a condescending cock.

&gt;The leaders ""spoke up"" as much as they could.

No they didn't, and here is where cataclysms and mops story goes off the rails. They hid in their own place at razor hill, and no one did anything. Here's a fact: No one did anything until late MoP, that's just how it is, you can't argue that. And in relation to that, there's no way that the orcs are numerous enough to wipe out the others. They have been hit heavy by different wars, and they weren't that many to begin with. The fact that Garrosh is fighting on so many fronts is a lorelol to begin with.

&gt; though Baine rebelled in the form of warning Jaina of an attack so she could prepare for it.

Thaaaat's, not a rebellion. He still attacked, and he still helped Garrosh get the divine bell. Funny you didn't know that, considering your knowledge of the lore.

&gt;Or that Theramore was realistically a reasonable military target, given that it had been used by the Alliance in their war against the Horde. Heck, the only reason anyone in the Horde would oppose sacking Theramore was because of Jaina being there. That's it.

I have never, anywhere, claimed that Theramore was not a military target, or a legit target. So take your strawman and fuck right off. If you are going to argue, at least do so honestly. Don't start an argument about something I've never claimed. 

&gt;They didn't know about the mana bomb, so couldn't speak against it or rebel against it or anything. When they found out, they were pissed, because Garrosh lied to them and wasted lives to make the initial attack ""more convincing.""

Listen, you don't get to say ""I shit, I didn't know about that weapon of mass destruction. That's bad."" and then go ""But I'll help you get a hold of another"", without someone saying you're a two-faced dickbag. The honorable fighters, the ""Lok'tar Ogar"" is only applicable when the ""death"" part is not so certain. The Horde likes to paint themselves as honorable fighters, to the death. Yet, when faced with dishonorable tactics, they tuck their tails between their legs and toe the line. 

&gt;Funny that you claim to ""know more lore than"" me, but don't know these basic things.

Well, you still haven't refuted the fact that no leaders rebelled either before, or right after the Theramore attack. So, what lore do you ""know""?

Also, you're not discussing lore, and you haven't refuted a single point. Just said ""they did speak up"" with no evidence. I have presented evidence, and it's known that they didn't do this until late MoP. And it's **ME** that doesn't know lore?

&gt;The lieutenants sent by Lor'themar and Sylvanas weren't keen on it, and got murdered afterward as a result, as did anyone who spoke against it.

First of all, this only proves that Malkorok and Garrosh are psycopaths, which we already knew. 

Secondly, this is not pertinent to the discussion at hand, which was: DOES JAINA KNOW ABOUT THIS?

No, she doesn't. From Jainas point of view, no apparent revolt happened after the deployment of a weapon of mass destruction got deployed with a stolen blue dragon artifact, with the assistance of Kirin Tor members. 

Not only that, but it happened **AGAIN**. Twice now, has the Horde as a united faction, conspired to put a gigantic weapon of mass destruction in the hands of Orc Hitler.

These are **FACTS**, and is impossible to dispute. The reason I am more knowledgable about lore than you, is because I look at it from both sides. I have many Alliance and Horde characters on 110, and I've read every single book. Let's take a look at the facts from **JAINAS** point of view, which is what we were discussing.(You still struggle with the context thing, I see.)

- The Horde sacks her city, kills a lot of people using a weapon of mass destruction.

- No one revolts

- The Sunreavers betray her a second time, and Garrosh is still aided by Baine to get the Divine Bell.

Now, here is where a lot of people chime in and say ""Well, not every Sunreaver betrayed her, most were innocent.""

And this is true, however, Jaina doesn't know who is innocent and who isn't. It's a time of war, and there are dangerous weapons and conspiracies about. Should she guess? She doesn't have the time to interrogate every single Sunreaver and try to assess whether or not they lie to her. It's an impossible task, and some of the Sunreavers have shown they would rather wipe out entire races than work for peace. We also know that Jaina has been kept in the dark regarding the Blood Elves disappointment/resentment towards Garrosh, as Varian tells her off for what she did. So in essence, Jaina doesn't know, and has to act on the information she is given.


To your other arguments, which is that they couldn't rebel out of fear for their lives. This is where Cataclysm and MoP has huge problems with the lore, but since you possess exactly zero critical thinking or reasoing skills, you don't know dick about lore. The problem is that the writers had Garrosh pull forces out of his ass whenever it was convenient. The Horde is made up of races most of which has been on the brink of extinction. Even the Orcs, which are the most numerous ones, aren't that many. It's frankly impossible for them to wage the full scale war that they did. It would've been far better storytelling to show them using guerilla tactics and cunning, instead of the ""orc smash""-storyline we got. 

The amount of ships that left for Kalimdor does not give them that many numbers.

So this is my last reply to you, because you're a vapid, useless, braindead, maggot infested Horde fanboy with absolutely abysmal knowledge of the lore, paired with zero basic reasoning skills and no critical thinking. In short, you're a fucking retarded cockmuncher, and your arrogance is severely misplaced, as you don't know dick. And you're unable to discuss what was the original argument, which was about Jaina. You're the typical moronic Horde fanboy paired with only enough knowledge to be absolutely lethally useless.",

After that one every SB win has felt better than the last. I'm truly fortunate that I became a fan when I did and just happened to pick the team I did.

2316,"But their other beliefs aren't mostly the same. A large part of Judiasm is that the laws Jews follow are not what is directly sourced from the Torah, like most Messianic ""Jews"", but laws created over many centuries of interpretation by the scholars of the past. Judaism strongly follows a phrase near the end of the Torah, ""lo bashamayim hi"", (roughly meaning ""not in heaven"") which has been taken to mean that the law is out of G-d's hands, and in the hands of the scholars of each generation. Therefore, Jewish law shifts constantly, based on what is practical for the current age.

Judaism goes far with this topic, with a well-known midrash (Pretty much a fanfiction; there are different schools of thought on how canon midrashim should be considered) telling the story of a rabbi who tried to convince his colleagues of his viewpoint through heavenly signs, eventually culminating in G-d announcing from the skies that he was right. Of course, the other rabbis just quoted ""Lo bashamayim hi"", and were not swayed by G-d's opinion.

In contrast, Halakha is not followed by most Messianic jews, and messianic jews consider the New Testament to be canon. Based on this, to call Messianic Jews and Jews the same thing is not too far from calling Christianity and Judaism the same thing. Sure, Messianic Jews hold prayer services that resemble those of Jews more than those of Christians, but those prayer services also are modified to mention Jesus.

To call Jesus a prophet, and then go further and call him the messiah, is completely against Jewish beliefs. A group of Christians renaming themselves Jews, then following surface-level Jewish traditions while still holding on to Jesus are not Jews. They are Christians who act like Jews for the purposes of converting Jews to follow Jesus.",anime

We expect raiders to take the time to research their spec and be prepared to maximise our time in raids. This means being able to be consistent and prepared. We prefer some raiding history, but are willing to take on people new to raiding. A good attitude is key, with the ability to take constructive criticism and learn from mistakes.

Current Progression Recruiting Needs:

**Tank**… Closed

**Healers**… Open

**Melee DPS**… Open

**Ranged DPS**… Open

I would still say that because it's difficult to verify that the animal was consenting it should be considered wrong (even if it might be a victim-less crime) just because if it's allowed then non-consenting animals could easily be abused. It might also be unethical to do that because it would create a risk of diseases spreading between species.",AskReddit

Second, one might think that in the face of the immediate harms that befall victims of racism we don't have the luxury of waiting until academic disagreement dies down over the best conception of racism. Real people are on the unpleasant end of racist attitudes and actions, and you might think that there's an obligation to ameliorate those harms as soon as possible, even without a finished theory of racism in hand.",

I don't watch many anime movies for some unknown reason (probably because a 30min commitment is easier than a 1 hour 30 minute commitment), but holy crap was the animation something. Just the lighting and character movements, not to mention the sakuga moments. 

The 3d backgrounds bothered me for exactly 2 minutes and 10 seconds. It eventually blended in perfectly with the rest of the movie. 

As for the actual movie, it was so... different. And yet not. Like the music, the designs, the non narration. It was so different from what monogatari is. (Except the backgrounds. They are actually something I would expect from a show like monogatari)

And yet it worked perfectly for this series. And I can't explain why. 

Don't need to talk about the plot since its what I expected, although I loved Shinobu and Araragi's meeting. It was again so different from everything else in the series, that it made it feel so monumental. 

Speaking of Shinobu, I had eventually made the tough decision to widdle down my best monogatari girl to Shinobu, Hanekawa, and Kanbaru. I eventually picked Kanbaru.

Boy is this movie already making me question the sanity of my decision.   

[](#towel)

Last thing to mention is that some threads have gone up recently about a watch order, and while its not really disputed among people like Fate, people generally agree to watch this sometime after Bakemonogatari. People can argue where in the timeline exactly, but people agree not to watch this first. And I completely agree with that. 

And yet... I wonder what someone's reaction to this would be if it was their first entry in the series? How would they react? I would fucking love to get someone's reaction. It would definitely be filled with a little confusion, but not too much as it is the beginning of a story. I think it would also be filled with a type of awe. Just like ""what is this?"" with confused enjoyment as they watched. Well... that's assuming they like it at all. 

All I know is that I was struck with amazement throughout the movie. I guess an 8 or 9 out of 10. I honestly can't decide. Will flip coin.

If the Saudis cannot protect the Holy Cities, and those on pilgrimage there, then it will create political unrest.  Nations will demand that their citizens be protected, and the Saudis will be embarrassed.  Other nations will demand that they get to protect their own citizens - and the only way to do that, is to make the Holy Cities, International territory, and get non Saudi troops involved.

Iran doesn't care about the Houthis - what Iran cares about is its place in the middle East; why do you think Hezbollah is backed by Iran - it extends Iranian power into other areas of the region.

Should missiles even land near mecca, iran could disavow knowledge of it easily - the way Russia did with the shooting down of the airliner over Ukraine.  They however have a lot to gain by discrediting the Saudi government, which I suspect is why THAAD was bought, to beef up defences.",worldnews

2593,"Blizzard has been trying to avoid merging servers by using bandaid methods for years now, like ""connecting servers"", cross realm guilds and CRZ.  They've been dancing around actually merging servers, probably because merging servers looks bad business wise - shareholders see closing/merging servers as a sign of a dying MMO.  These bandaids give a semblance of player interaction, but because everyone is on a different server, you probably won't see that person again unless you actively add them as a BNet Friend etc.  

This is NOT how you make a community.  Having less servers with more people on it (especially for the very low pop servers) which have local guilds, friends, people you see daily and interact with and recognize, is the solution.  It's one Blizzard is hesitant to take - they make a decent amount off of character transfers, and they don't wanna directly upset investors/shareholders/Activision by closing down servers.

First start off with one thing. Breakfast is tough? Try this, do you like eggs? If yes, get a muffin pan and buy egg whites, spinach and turkey bacon(I love chicken bacon, less processed). Make the turkey bacon first. Then in the muffin pan add, egg whites, spinach and cut up turkey bacon. Add all the spices you like(no to low sodium) and place in the oven. Total prep time 3 mins, total cook time with turkey bacon, 15 minutes. This makes 5 to 8 egg muffins, enough for the work week. 

This is amazing, bc you don't have to make it everyday and you can eat it on the go. 

Try this for one week and see how you do. This will jump start your meal prep. And if you like it you can add another thing like meal prep snacks for all week and so on!

Think of it as the ISP running an ad blocker, but for Overwatch. They monitor all traffic on their end and will let most things through(the website itself), but anytime they see Overwatch(the advertisement) come through, they stop it cold.

As far as I am aware, one could set up a VPN somewhere that it is not being throttled and get around it. The ISP themselves would only see the connection attempt to the VPN and not anything specific to Overwatch.

Another one of anime's strengths is slice of shows, because you can't find shows in this genre outside of anime and manga. Some of these are closer to sitcoms in that they're more humor based, but the stakes are lower than in sitcoms and they tend to aim for a 
somewhat relaxing and heartwarming tone. There's slice of life anime that incorporate other genres as well. A subgenre known as iyashikei is even more laidback which I don't think you'll enjoy.

Regardless of if a parent does a good job at it or not, they're still one of the primary social group and socialization vessel for their children unless they're distant or absent all together (which has it's own connotations). There will be deviants, but that just doesn't change that family is the primary source of this learning and processes. Since they are part of this primary process, actions such as teaching a child religion is far more acceptable than, say, a stranger doing it without the knowledge of the parents.

&gt;You cannot, at any time, simply assume that because those adults are a kid's parents that they have the best interests of the child at heart.

Not that this even has anything to do with the original point, but I didn't suggest they did. I said it is their position to raise the child and build its character and behavior. Again, obviously there will be deviants, but that doesn't make me wrong about their roles.

&gt;They are every bit as capable of conditioning the child

The issue isn't whether they are capable of conditioning, the issue is whether strangers should be doing it to other people's children. It absolutely isn't their position to be making children do anything like this without the knowledge or approval of the parents, who are in that position.

2700,"i agree, but it should be noted that everyone has 2 ranks.

first one is there 'carry' rank or current rank. its where you are less effective in terms of carrying but are still slightly better then the average at that rank.

second one is your max rank, this is the highest rank that player can be effective at that time.

for me my 2nd rank is 3300 (im 3300 season high on my main sitting at 3240 atm) but my first rank is bout 2800

once i hit 2800 i have a HARD time carrying bad matches.

1500-2799 is fairly easy, but for w/e reason the ppl at 2800 are just slightly better to the point i have to put forth 10 times more effort then i would only a few SR away.

its like trying to lift 300 lbs of dead weight, its doable, my alt account will eventually hit 3300 but holy shit is it so much of a grind sometimes lol

u can only soft carry when your about 500 sr from your max.

so a player that is able to hard carry that 2800 but is only high diamond, more then likely caps out at 3800. but its possible they havnt hit that sr yet purely because they havnt played enough.

its a bit of a grind to your 'max sr'",Overwatch
2701,"I think that Reddit can come off very anticapitalist. It is difficult to argue for universal healthcare or basic income or take many of the socioeconomic stances that many Redditors take without coming off as anticapitalist.

This may be contributed to a very loud minority, or it just might be that these Redditors are indeed capitalists at heart, but are proposing individual solutions to fix some of capitalisms flaws rather than suggesting an entirely new economic system and it comes off the wrong way.

You could be the most conservative republican on every other issue but happen to be pro-choice, and if someone hears that you're pro-choice and knows nothing else about you, they'd assume you lean politically left. In the same way you could be entirely capitalist but believe that minimum wage should be increased.

She got my number from my friend and started texting me. I texted her on and off for about a year, and we always planned to hang out, but she didn't have her license yet, had strict parents, and I couldn't drive either. (I'm 20 and I still don't have my license. I was about 17 then though) Eventually, she got a boyfriend, but she would still text me from time to time. A year later she started again hardcore, and said she was in love with me, even though she still had a boyfriend. We would sext all the time and send pictures to each other. (I was still a virgin at the time.) Eventually, we finally met up one day when I was home from school and we made out for hours in her car, and had oral sex. She missed me even more after this, she said. Then one day, she said she couldn't do it anymore, and didn't even have a reason. I was very upset, but since it was only technically a ""text relationship"" I tried not to let it bother me too much. Eventually, she texted me one day and said she was sorry and that she didn't want ""us"" to be over. I agreed and we continued for another couple of months or so. But then, something crazy happened, I fell for someone who was falling for me as well, so I did what I knew I had to do. I ended it with her, citing the reason as I felt that we would never see each other in person as she said she always ""couldn't."" This was another reason for ending it. It was extremely frustrating that she was ""too busy"" for the one that she cared about more than anyone else. I felt bad, and she was very upset, and I did tell her I found someone. I didn't talk to her for the rest of the year. Then, my girlfriend, turned out to be huge bitch, so that ended. And the texting girl went off to college. She still talks to me if I initiate, but has no interest in me anymore. College changes people, and she realized that she could get hotter guys than me, I think haha.

We already see this when people want to compare people to Wilt and it has to be mentioned of how the average skill level was much lower in that era compared to now and how due to rule differences there were more shot opportunities etc which allowed for Wilt's 100 point game etc and how it's almost impossible to actually compare players from the 80s, 90s, and current day to Wilt.

I watched my girlfriend go over the edge of an embankment and disappear before my eyes. At that moment I thought she would be dead when I got to the bottom. She fell 15 feet landing on rocks and old chunks of cement. When I got down to her she was amazingly still conscious. Her face was almost unrecognizable I was so scared and I had no idea what to do. The guy who pulled out Infront of her looked down at us and asked ""uh should I call an ambulance?"" And I said yes like right now. I tried talking to my girlfriend but she wasn't making any sense. She kept asking the same questions over and over. Like where am I? I would then tell her where we were and she would then ask what did we do earlier that day? I went through our whole day and then she would ask where she was again? That's when I got really scared because I immediately thought the worst and figured she had major brain damage. The worst thing was having to keep my composure so she didn't think she was too injured. She then started to insist that she should just take a nap right there. I knew that was a clear sign of a concussion and that it was a bad idea for her to rest. So I kept trying to talk to her. God I'm seriously shaking right now typing this out... Anyways the emergency vehicles start showing up very quickly I might add thank God for them. A few fire fighters came down so they could strap her onto a board to drag her up the embankment. They get her in the ambulance and then to the hospital we went. They cleaned up her face wounds a bit her parents showed up about an hour later after we got there. Very emotional scene obviously, her grandparents showed up too. So they did all her x-ray scans and she had 4 broken bones in her face and ended up needing emergency surgery and got a bunch of stitches. When she went to surgery I went to the restroom and I just couldn't stop crying. It's really hard seeing your loved one go into surgery knowing there's not a damn thing you can do to help. Just sitting there waiting and waiting which dragged on for what seemed an eternity. When she got out of surgery things started slowly getting better. We ended up staying at the hospital  for 4 nights. She has titanium plates in her face but the surgeons did a great job. So now she looks better than ever but she still has issues from the accident almost a year later. Her knee makes standing/walking for too long unbearable and her short term memory is still a little off. She recently got diagnosed with PTSD and depression directly related to this accident.

Please bear in mind that when you're in TJ, you are not *really* in Mexico. Technically, you are. But it's just one big tourist trap. But not really in a bad way, exactly. You're just going from one of America's nicest cities into the Third World in a few miles. 

Someone said to skip TJ and see the San Diego Zoo instead. Do both. San Diego has one of the best zoos in the world. Tijuana does too, but in a different way. 

One thing that intrigues me is that TJ opened a new opera house a few years ago, and I hear it's first rate. It's really hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of opera in Tijuana.

[**First pull**](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/p4KfHPQCxAXv3bTm/#view=analytical&amp;fight=1&amp;type=summary&amp;source=12)


You continuously let your rupture drop, your garrote isn't up for over half of the fight, uptimes are generally terrible, do you have addons or weakauras for tracking your debuffs? If not, you should really have a look into that, or paying more attention to them if you already have them.

Your surge of toxins uptime is really low, I see you from 23 to 42 seconds into the fight, casting 11 fan of knives, 1 mutilate but only 2 finishers. You're wasting a lot of chances to proc poison bombs here

You wasted over 100 combo points this fight, that's over a third of your combo points, make sure you actually spend them, that's 20 finishers you missed right there.

It appears that you don't use your cooldowns enough, you had a total of ONE vanish cast in an eight minute pull, five vendetta casts and eight kingsbanes, giving a total of FOUR missed vanishes, three missed vendettas &amp; FOUR missed kingsbanes.

Use your kingsbane on cooldown, use toxic blades on cooldown, use vendetta on cooldown. Hold vanish for vendetta.


I took a quick look at some of the other pulls, and it appears to be concurrent issues. 

I would recommend that you give [this page](https://riff.tf/guide/assassination/) a thorough read-through, and try to actively pay attention to holding your bleeds up, spending combo points when you're capped, and not overcapping on energy (you spent approximately 10% of the fight with full energy).

Hope this helps!


Sidenote: Your mastery is **very** low. I went ahead and [simmed your character](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/wtnAvwMED83PbnLNQxQVLr) for some stat weights for you on raidbots.com, I'd recommend you download the addon ""Pawn"" and import this string: 

( Pawn: v1: ""Hyperogue - Assassination (Raidbots)"": Class=Rogue, Spec=Assassination, Agility=19.72, CritRating=17.53, HasteRating=8.42, MasteryRating=19.28, Versatility=15.00 )

I was an IT contractor at what is primarily a non-combat trade training base from 1999 - 2002.  While the security climate changed after 9/11 and the general level of anxiety increased with the prospect of deployment for the soldiers, I didn't sense any real difference when it came to racism or hatred of Muslims.  While the demographic of personnel was majority white, soldiers of colour seemed to be treated like any other soldier while on duty and as buddies while out of uniform.

In B.C. there used to be a government monopoly which has now been semi privatized (meaning both government and private stores exist).  Private stores are *always* more expensive and *always* have worse selection.  A bottle of Jamesons will often be 20% cheaper at a government store than at a private and the reason the private stores stay in business is that most of the government ones were shut down when the market was privatized.  The private stores that have good selection are heavily specialized (ie., have 4,000 varieties of red wine, two varieties of beer and no hard liquor).

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

The image of Rosalie holding up the gun was absolutely heart pounding. It was brutal and cold. The image of her condemning her mother alone was another great little scene.  
  
totally agree, the scene was a fantastic culmination of her character arc so far and gives such a weight to her moment at the end of the episode. it was just such a powerful way to signal how she's developed as a person and how important her interactions with Oscar had been so far!

The more you learn about it, the more complex and amazing it is. Totally mind-blowing the fact we need the most advanced aeronautical and 3D design software to built and understand the advance geometry of the church today, yet everything was planned and created by 1 man alone more than a century ago... I feel one could be learning something new about the Sagrada Família every day for a lifetime and it still wouldn't be enough to comprehend and understand this masterpiece.

For example, something I learned recently: did you know that the church not only has an [organ](http://www.orguesblancafort.com/facana-posterior.jpg) inside (like all the others in the world), but the church itself was designed by Gaudí to be a massive organ? The church being a musical instrument itself. Gaudí spend years studying/working and designing tubular bells. His idea is every [tower](http://i.imgur.com/uYpXJ4c.jpg) (a total of 13 bell towers) you see on the church will be able to produce a different sounds, being played like a keyboard. Every facade produces a different sound, depending on the symbology of the facade and purpose. The result is all the possible sounds of a regular piano, but the sound comes from massive tubular bells on every massive tower. From 1 keyboard inside the church it can be possible to play both the internal/regular organ and the exterior monumental organ. The ""exterior"" one is meant to be listened from all the city.",europe

3rd party gold still exists obviously and is generally cheaper then buying it in game, if said company actually wants to stay in business but it comes with inherent risks. Now you have them expanding from the gold market and into selling runs for real money, because Blizzard effectively capped the market at whatever gold costs in game, which doesn't allow the 3rd party sites to control their overhead so they do runs instead.

High end guilds doing this undermines something that is working it; has nothing to do with ethics at all. If you're buying runs that's fine, but you're propping up a failing business practice by going through these 3rd party sites, you're supporting account theft and sale . By going to these guilds instead you might think to yourself that you're in the right because you're not supporting the above practices so you're free and clear but if you couldn't, because the risk of ban was so high that guilds would stop doing it, then you would be at the mercy of the 3rd party companies and all the risks inherent to participating in it. 

If I wanted to buy a run I would absolutely go through a guild, I would not however go through a 3rd party site. It has nothing to do with the ethics behind it and everything to do with risk. If you eliminate gold runs via guilds you again lower the amount of accounts available to run these 3rd party runs by proxy and eventually remove and or cap another source of income for said services further tightening your financial hold on them until it's not longer profitable and they move on to something else. Guilds generally charge more, because it's ""safer"" and so forth so the 3rd party sites don't have that price ceiling pressure that the gold market has. Eliminate the safe method and they go into competition with each other and slowly kill off the smaller ones, which are the most dangerous entities in the system in terms of risk they'll take to stay in business and you have another small victory. 

It's all about the small victories in the arena of 3rd party market systems in games, there are hundreds of articles about it. Anytime you allow the player base to sell things in game for real money you undermine everything you've done to combat it.",wow

&gt; Madvillain is a hip-hop duo that consists of emcee MF DOOM and producer Madlib.

&gt; In the summer of 2002 it was announced that MF DOOM and Madlib were working together on a project which, at that time, had no title or projected release date. The two first met up at the Stones Throw house in Los Angeles  where Madlib's studio The Bomb Shelter existed in a former 1950s-era bomb shelter.  Doom immediately immersed himself in Madlib's music and began writing lyrics and recording demos. He would continue revising lyrics and re-recording vocals for over a year. 

&gt; Madlib took off to Brazil in late 2002 for the Red Bull Music Academy, where early cuts of Madvillain were premiered for the first time. (These demos were also copied and subsequently bootlegged - and the demos were later released on Madvillainy 2: The Box).

&gt; Back in Los Angeles, in mid-2003, DOOM &amp; Madlib took over a bedroom to record vocals. First released was the Money Folder b/w America's Most Blunted 12-inch single in the Fall of 2003. Their debut album, Madvillainy, was released in March 2004.

&gt; The music on Madvillainy went against the grain of all popular conventions in contemporary hip-hop: short songs, dirty sound, no choruses, and with lyrical themes which were not always clear to everyone on first listen. The album received the highest critical praise of a hip-hop album released in 2004, and years later has continued to generate interest and controversy.

&gt; In 2005, two remix EPs from Madvillainy were released on Stones Throw, including  Four Tet Remixes and Koushik Remixes.

&gt; MF DOOM went on to work with DANGERDOOM (with Danger Mouse), Gorillaz and Ghostface Killah. Madlib has continued developing his diverse production style for the likes of Erykah Badu, Talib Kweli, Ghostface Killah, as well as releasing several solo products under his own name and self-made creations Quasimoto, Yesterday's New Quintet, and Beat Konducta. 

&gt; In 2008, prolific as usual, Madlib remixed Madvillainy in its entirety, titled Madvillainy 2: The Madlib Remix. It was released in a limited edition box set in 2008.

&gt; DOOM and Madlib have worked on a second Madvillain album on and off for several years. If you're waiting for it, wait in line behind us.  Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/6515d5fb5b4b4db49d05bcdc1e2a12d0.png) [artist playlist](https://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thefirehose/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all&amp;only=music&amp;q=Prince+The+Revolution ""uses reddit search, results may vary"")  

&gt; Prince formed The Revolution in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979 as his backing band for his first concert tour. The original lineup consisted of Gayle Chapman on keyboards, André Cymone on bass, Dez Dickerson on guitar, Doctor Fink on keyboards and Bobby Z. on drums &amp; percussion.

&gt; The band went nameless for almost three years while supporting Prince live and appearing in his music videos. Chapman and Cymone left in the early 1980's and were replaced by Lisa Coleman on keyboards and Brownmark on bass. The first album on which The Revolution performed was the 1982 Prince release, 1999, which has the band's moniker written in reverse on the back cover. 

&gt; When the 1999 Tour ended in 1983, Dez Dickerson left the band for religious reasons and was replaced by Lisa's childhood friend and soon-to-be lover Wendy Melvoin on guitar. The first album officially released as Prince &amp; The Revolution was Purple Rain in 1984, which sold over 16 million copies in the United States alone. 

&gt; The band's sound incorporated heavy metal, pop, funk, R&amp;B and hard rock elements. Wendy Melvoin &amp; Lisa Coleman formed a particular creative bond with Prince and greatly influenced the band's output during the rest of their tenure. The band achieved two number-one Billboard 200 albums (Purple Rain &amp; Around The World In A Day), six top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and won three Grammy Awards. 

&gt; In 1985, members of the soon-to-be-defunct group The Family (which, in turn, included former members of another group, The Time) joined The Revolution, along with people from Sheila E.'s band. This included the addition of three dancers/vocalists/comic foils (known as The Bodyguards).

&gt; The last lineup of Prince &amp; the Revolution was informally known as the Counter-Revolution and consisted of:

&gt; - Jerome Benton (The Bodyguards)
- Atlanta Bliss (trumpet)
- Greg Brooks (The Bodyguards)
- Lisa Coleman (keyboards, piano and vocals)
- Doctor Fink (keyboards and vocals)
- Eric Leeds (saxophone)
- Brown Mark (bass guitar and vocals)
- Susannah Melvoin (backing vocals)
- Wendy Melvoin (guitar and vocals)
- Prince (lead vocals, guitar, and piano)
- Wally Safford (The Bodyguards)
- Miko Weaver (guitar)
- Bobby Z. (drums)

&gt; The Revolution was officially disbanded by Prince in 1986 after the Hit N Run tour, which supported Parade, the soundtrack for the movie Under the Cherry Moon. Melvoin and Coleman went on to a successful career as Wendy &amp; Lisa. Read more on Last.fm.

Here's something to think about for you flat earthers. I hope you ""believe"" in basic trigonometry, and can use a sextant and an atomic clock.

Use https://spotthestation.nasa.gov (oh no, it's NASA, must be fake!) And get the location of where it is supposed to be. Then, get a friend, flat earther preferred(two birds, one stone), who is at least 300 miles away (is distance even real?).

Now, set a time on a night to mark the position of the ISS, and get the angle of the station measuring from the direction your friend is in. For best results, do it twice, one facing the direction of where your friend would be on a globe, the other if it were flat. Now, let's calculate the parallax!!

Using the two angles you can create a triangle that solves for the intersection angle of your measurement and his. Then, make it into two right triangles by drawing a line. Now, using Pythagoras' theorem, you can measure the distance between the ISS and the ground. 

Depending if you measured twice, you will see that both answers(you will most likely be off some) will be far above where the supposed ""firmament"" is. If you want to verify this method works, go try it measuring the angles between two landmarks and where you are. Then measure one of the distances. Do the same calculation and then check your answer on Google maps, or even do it manually.

If you have the desire to really know the truth, try this experiment. I'm sure there's more than enough distance between you guys to try this.   ",conspiracy
3217,"Well, Hook 2.0 wasn't to make the hook weaker or stronger directly, it was to make the hook more consistent. With Hook 2.0, only the legitimate hooks (which were most of them anyway) count. 

The issue with Hook 1.0 is that it was always a one shot kill, unless as you said, it pulls them to an odd position and you miss some pellets. It essentially allowed Roadhog to hook you if any part of your body was visible and unobstructed. No matter how many walls, doors, rocks, and corners it needed to pull you through.

While Hook 2.0 made it easier to shoot the opponent after they got hooked, it didn't really change the one shot kill potential.

This is my opinion, but I feel as if Hog pulling someone off-center or diagonally relative to his position (Not like 2.0 or 3.0. Like it was originally) made it feel as if the opponent being dragged had weight to them, and it overall felt more realistic. Now it seems to just snatch the enemy out of midair, and pull them towards you like a weightless object, then stop with a snap right in front of you.

I watched countless documentaries on it. Suicides' in Japan are extremely interesting to me. The suicide forest, the blue lights on the train tracks, the cliff. I also find documentaries on people in the Netherlands and Switzerland  where euthanasia is legal, who are preparing to die. 

I enjoyed ""Hours"" and ""A perfect day for banana fish"". My favorite peace was an episode by Radio Lab about  a guy who killed himself. S-Town was also amazing.

 I don't romanticize suicide. I just find it strange. The strangest thing a conscious being can do is try to stop itself from being conscious. 

 There's a building in my town where people jump from(small town, not a lot of high buildings with roof access). I go there often, just to look at the building. I think there's something in the architecture that also plays a role (something like /r/evilbuilding).

  In the city where I am currently studying, there is a bridge where a local famous writer jumped into the river and drowned. It's a popular suicide spot.

Would investment go elsewhere?  I mean, probably?  If I had hundreds of thousands sitting around I'd want to invest it *safely*.

They were both expecting a return on an investment (former is money, latter is time), but only the money investment is respected.

You could turn the argument around: What's the overarching rationale for fucking over workers on their pensions?  Is it to encourage investment in Canadian companies by mortgaging the future of the population?

The problem is that the clouds are moving while taking these pics, literally all the guy did was correct the clouds so it looked more appropriate. 

Again all common knowledge to people who have looked this up. 

There are currently two satellites taking full unedited images of earth.

&gt; Julie Covington (born September 11, 1947 in London) is an English singer and actress best known for recording the original version of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"".

&gt; Covington's break came in 1967 when, whilst still a student at Homerton College, Cambridge, she was invited to sing on David Frost's television show, after which she secured a record deal. She followed with her 1971 Godspell casting at The Roundhouse, followed by her 1972 original cast recording of Godspell (Day by Day). 

&gt; After moving from the theatre, her performance in the 1976 television show Rock Follies led to her landing the title role in the original studio recording of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical Evita. She scored an international number one with the song ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"".

&gt; After a second solo album, and guesting on other artists' albums, she returned to the theatre.

&gt; She also plays the parson's wife on Jeff Wayne's 1978 recording 'The War of the Worlds' in which she sang the song 'The Spirit of Man'. Read more on Last.fm.

3435,"1. There was always an understanding in EU that countries specialize in some matters based on history and expiriences. Spain had most saying about relations with Marocco, France with Algeria and West Africa etc etc.  There was always element of so called ""white guilt"" in this, former colonial powers were historically, politically and culturally interested in some regions, exploited them, took people from them so that all was natural.
2. EEU countries had none of that. For last centuries they fought for their own survival from German onslaught. For EEU countries Syria was a fairytale country far away. 
3. EEU countries also faced centuries of brutal wars with Muslim Turks. Some suffered centuries of occupation and oppression from Muslim overlords. There is little illusion there about Islam.
4. There was war in Chechnya not long ago, there is a war in Ukraine. Both generated many refugees and immigrants that came to Poland. So yes Poland takes refugees and immigrants  - natural way, when they come and ask for help. Not when they are forced there and have to be kept by force as they don't want to be in V4.
5. War in Syria is a civil war not foreign invasion you can do nothing about. Syrians should stop killing themseves and start talking - did you considered such revolutionary idea? Maybe we should force them to do that? But no, let's build NS and NS2 to give Russia more money for Assad and more planes to fuck everything up. That's WE solution?
6. V4 countries were proposing solutions. Solutions to curb immigration not to fuel it up. Nobody else cares about that it seems.
7. We must see these event in long term. Besides constant wars, terrorists attacks there is also climate change and unchecked population growth in MENA. There are dozens of millions of poor and oppressed people there and encouraged by welcome policy they will be coming. It's unsustainable.
8. Tha way last waves of immigration from MENA countries were handled disgusted and terrified V4 countries. Nobody wants that, nobody will consciously allow that. The way Angela Merkel just decided for Europe, the way German media collectively were and still are viciously attacking V4, the way EU bureaucracy supports that, threats, blackmail. EEU recoiled, it brought worst memories and fears of German domination and defiance kicked in. That was great fail of Angela Merkel and her shills. Years of building trust waisted.
9. V4 countries never exploited Africa or Middle East, never had black slaves like WE,  there is no ""white guilt"" in EEU.  You can't shame these people into obedience.
10. Your remark about lacking mental ability is arrogant and racist. It fits hate campaign against V4 nicely. Not far from calling people there subhumans. And you wonder why V4 countries dug in their heels?

Situation is much more complicated that you seem to comprehend - talk about mental ability here. Shortsighted, i'll-advised, suicidal plans won't fly. WE can make and absorb great mistakes. EEU can't afford that on many levels, social, civilizational etc.",europe
3436,"Not everybody will ever be happy with loot distribution. Because 95% of raid groups/guilds have 50% core and 50% carries. For example my last guild just did a roll for loot system and I was not happy about it. Because you have me, a rogue, pull 800k at the time and lets say another rogue pulling 500k. Then we kill the boss and he wins it because he got lucky and rolled higher. I always believe the people that are the core reason you actually progress should be fed gear first. Simple as that. Adversely, in my new guild we run ML and we are feeding tier to our top dps first. No question about it. The rogue is #1 every fight in that tier token? He gets his 4 set first.

3498,"When Mao died in the 1970's one of his revolutionary buddies, Deng Ziaoping, became the intellectual guiding force for China. He brought many changes, but possibly the most important were that China would focus on reforms and openness, and there would be Four Modernizations, namely in agriculture, industry, science and technology and the military. With this came the big switch, where China would abandon the Soviet-style of planned economy and create 'socialism with Chinese characteristics.'

This is a unique variant of market-based socialism, and it has been the political and economic structure of China for the last few decades. 

Many large industries are state-owned, and the government owns the Central Bank and tightly controls all the other ones. There are not really price-controls as such like in Stalinist days, but the market also does not control the economy. There are many cooperatives, independently-owned small businesses and State/private sector partnerships. Large market-owned corporations like in pure capitalist countries are rare, and not really a force in society.

Unlike what some people believe, the Chinese government claims that they are not moving towards a capitalist market-based economy, rather that they are developing a hybrid economy within the confines of socialist thought and action.

The Chinese Communist Party has 80 million members and they are constitutionally the most powerful political party. Not only do they control the military, own and control State enterprises, control long-term planning for China, but they elect the Standing Committee and the General Secretary which are the most powerful political bodies.

Anyway, China is it's own civilization that is making up their own rules as they go along, and one thing we can be sure of is that they are not going to ever fit into a European model of what a society is supposed to be. 

If you ignore the American concept that socialism means social welfare, and go with the traditional definition that it means worker ownership of the means of production, then China is a variant of a socialist country. Hell, their Constitution even guarantees that they remain socialist, if that means anything.  ",worldnews

I guess the real difference comes down to which way you lean between rating stuff by ""this show was something I liked"" vs ""this show was a bastion of quality"".",anime

3508,"&gt;Court cases stem from the harm suffered, the severity of the violation, the amount the person is liable for the result, and the amount of connection between the acts and the harm suffered.

And this is an open and shut case on all counts. Khadr suffered harm (torture) that the government willingly participated in through their interrogation assistance. Ergo, they made themselves party to his Charter violations, and opened themselves up to a huge liability.

&gt;Settlements absolutely stem from the settling parties opinions of the other.

No they don't. They stem from the merits of the case.

Believe it or not, the government has lawyers who are more qualified than you. This settlement was absolutely signed off by those lawyers and there is a report filed by those lawyers detailing the risks of taking it to trial. Even **if** the settlement is about the same (or even more) than Khadr might have gotten in a trial, the government was also unlikely to be interested in having even more of its laundry aired in public, and considering the costs of litigation in a case like this, add that together and you are likely looking at a pretty solid case for this settlement offer.

As for whether he would win, the laywers likely thought he would, otherwise they wouldn't have recommended it. And, given that the SCC ruled that his Charter rights were violated, I expect they took the word of the highest court at face value. Why you choose not to is beyond me.",

I just got back from seeing it in 70mm IMAX, and I am totally underwhelmed. Honestly, I think it's not the format to see it in. I was sitting pretty much smack-dab in the middle of the theater and the screen was just *too big*. You can't look at all of it. Plus, while the shots are very big, allllmost all of it is empty space, and the top is sky and the bottom is beach or water. So you have this HUGE shot, and the top 1/5^th and the bottom 1/5^th are basically just white or blue. There was very rarely anything actually going on in those parts of the screen, so... why the trouble? The dogfighting sequences felt like they earned being in IMAX but everything else? Eh.

I didn't even find it tense. I got surprised by loud noises in quieter scene (initial shots, and when they're hiding in the boat) but that's about it. Something about it completely failed to rope me in.

Completely unsarcastically, my favorite thing about the movie by far was Kenneth Branagh's uniform. I was like yeah, lookin' sharp man.

&gt; Talk Talk are commonly known for their early synthpop/New Wave singles, but are also considered forerunners in the post-rock genre for their later experimental albums.

&gt; Although they were identified with bands such as Duran Duran during the New Wave movement, Talk Talk had a progressive depth their contemporaries lacked. After keyboardist Simon Brenner was replaced with producer and unofficial member Tim Friese-Greene, each successive Talk Talk release became more sophisticated and original.

&gt; The band formed in London, England in 1981. Talk Talk began as a quartet consisting of Mark Hollis (vocals), Simon Brenner (keyboards), Lee Harris (drums) and Paul Webb (bass). They were generally associated with the New Wave movement; more specifically, in their early years, they were often compared with Duran Duran, as both bands not only featured a double-barreled name and a Roxy Music-inspired musical direction, but also a record label (EMI) and producer (Colin Thurston).

&gt; Talk Talk's first line-up released a self-titled debut EP in 1982 which was quickly expanded into a full-length album entitled The Party's Over. The band charted in the UK Top 40 with the singles ""Talk Talk"" and ""Today"", both produced by Thurston (who had also produced hits for Duran Duran and Howard Jones).

&gt; Brenner left after the 1983 non-LP single ""My Foolish Friend"", which was produced by frequent Roxy Music collaborator Rhett Davies. At this point, the band added unofficial fourth member Tim Friese-Greene, who became Talk Talk's keyboard player, producer, and Hollis' frequent writing partner. Although a major contributor to the band's studio output, Friese-Greene did not generally play with the band during live shows or appear in publicity material. Talk Talk stopped playing live in 1986.

&gt; Talk Talk eventually abandoned the New Wave style completely with The Colour of Spring in 1986. The single ""Life's what you make it"" allowed the album to become their greatest success in the UK. The success of The Colour of Spring afforded the band an open budget and schedule for the recording of their next album. About a year in the making, and featuring contributions from many outside musicians, Spirit of Eden was released in 1988, on EMI's Parlophone label. The album was assembled from many hours of improvised instrumentation that Hollis and Friese-Greene had edited and arranged using digital equipment. The result was a mix of rock, jazz, classical, and ambient music. While critically praised, the album was not as commercially viable as its predecessors, and the band declared they would not tour in support of it.

&gt; During the making of Spirit of Eden, Talk Talk manager Keith Aspden had attempted to free the band from their recording contract with EMI. ""I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with"", Aspden said. ""I was fearful that the money wouldn't be there to record another album."" EMI, however, wished to keep the band on their roster. After many months of litigation, the band ultimately succeeded in extracting themselves from the contract. EMI then sued the band, claiming that Spirit of Eden was not ""commercially satisfactory"", but the case was thrown out of court.

&gt; In 1990, Talk Talk agreed to a two-album contract with Polydor. They released Laughing Stock on the Verve Records imprint in 1991. By this time, Webb had left the group. Talk Talk had by then morphed into what was essentially a brand name for the studio recordings of Hollis and Friese-Greene, along with a bevy of session studio players (including long-term Talk Talk drummer Harris). Laughing Stock crystallized the experimental sound the band started with Spirit of Eden (which has been retroactively categorized as ""post-rock"" by some critics). Laughing Stock adopted an even more minimalist style than its predecessor, but this did not stop it achieving a respectable Top 30 showing in the UK Albums Chart.

&gt; With the band now released from EMI, the label released the retrospective compilation Natural History in 1990. It went on to sell over one million copies in Britain alone and rose to number 3 in the UK album chart. The 1984 single ""It's My Life"" was also re-released, and this time became the band's biggest success in their native country, making number 13 in the UK Singles Chart. Following up on this renewed popular interest in the band, the label released History Revisited in 1991, a compilation of 12 inch singles and alternative versions which made the Top 40, an unusually high showing for a remix album. The band sued EMI for remixing their material without permission.

&gt; After Laughing Stock, Talk Talk broke up in 1991. Paul Webb and Lee Harris went on to form the band .O.rang, while Tim Friese-Greene started recording under the name Heligoland. In 1998, Mark Hollis released his eponymous debut Mark Hollis, which was very much in keeping with the minimalist post-rock sound of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. According to Hollis's management, he has since retired. Webb collaborated under the name of Rustin Man with Beth Gibbons and released ""Out of Season"" in 2002, while Harris was featured on the Bark Psychosis album of 2004.

Honestly, I'm wondering where your line is. Where would you be like ""Yeah, Hillary would have been better."" It's obviously not that the president is the epitome of weakness -- ignorant, out-of-shape, tamper-throwing and immoral. Weakness of both mind and body. That's not enough? It's not that he lies to the public literally every day. Still not enough? It's not that his cabinet is full of Wall St billionaires? That people on his team have quit due to the Russian scandal? That the first executive order he signed was found unconstitutional by the lower courts? That members of his own party are talking about impeachment? That he clearly just doesn't know wtf he's doing? None of this is enough? 

Will it be when 16 million people get kicked off health insurance? Or perhaps when North Korea gets a nuke on an ICBM while he's tweeting about Morning Joe? Really, truly, at what point do you reconsider?

Nothing promotes the spirit of charity in this country like ensuring a fat chunk of your donations go straight into the pockets of lawyers, I guess.

But nobody else is taking over islands militarily, except Vietnam who controlled the most rocks in the Spratlys. And the Philippines who shot a Taiwanese fisherman for ""trespassing"".

Let's review the facts so far:

1. Proximity doesn't mean anything in territorial disputes.

2. Paracel Islands have been in Chinese control for decades without China trying to obstruct traffic.

3. China has zero reason to obstruct a maritime trading route, especially when it is responsible for making it worth trillions of dollars. China is also primarily an economic power instead of ""bigger stick diplomacy"" and it relies heavily on the Malacca bottleneck for its oil. In fact, these facts combine into China wanting to make sure the trade route stays OPEN.

Let's start at the beginning. You have a key consisting of half-pairs of entangled photons, i.e. a bunch of photons entangled with others elsewhere, most likely in a secure place. Once your key, your photons, are measured, they will collapse from their superposition and become unentangled. As I understand it quantum physics allows for your key, your photons, to be compared to the the other entangled half-pairs in the secure location I mentioned earlier.

Essentially, if you receive a key which doesn't work, you know that someone has attempted to access the secure information or otherwise tampered with the key, because the photons have been observed and are no longer entangled.",worldnews

I would be surprised if the situation is much different in any other Canadian city.  All the press releases, interviews, game recaps, etc. are all hosted on the team sites now.  Minutes after a goal you can see all of the highlights on the NHL site.  

Minutes after a game you can see the game recap and post-game live stream as well.  It's the same press asking the same questions so there's no need to read it in the paper or on the papers website.

So part of the warmness has to be due to the access to the team.  The whole post media chain seems like a sinking ship anyway.

3986,"&gt;Maybe due to limited ice time during his first seasons in Boston maybe?

It's one hundred percent because of this... You can add up his last 9 seasons and see that he's at 0.8578 ppg. That's more relevant than his first couple seasons with Boston, I believe at least one of which was in smaller role.

Don't get me wrong, Toews is talented offensively but I think you gotta hit those high numbers for recognition specifically regarding offense, it's hard to maintain those kind of PPGs over full seasons. 

There's also a shot differential between them that screams one is more focused on offense than the other. Kessel has almost 1000 more shots in 100 more games than Toews does. That's a ton.

Their reputations might also be somewhat related to the fact that Kessel was able to generate SO much offense for a team that didn't really have that many great players, so maybe Toews gets wrongly screwed a bit rep wise just because he plays for a better team.",hockey

It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.

The legislation created five Schedules (classifications), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each.

Being an Islamist doesn't suggest a greater degree of ""seriousness"", not only can an Islamist and ""moderate muslim"" believe the same volume of tenants (although different ones), but a moderate Muslim with the exact same beliefs can become an Islamist. It's surprisingly common because of the martyrdom get-out-of-hell-free card. If a moderate Muslim has lived a life of devotion, they don't feel the need to die advancing the cause of Islam to get into heaven. If they have instead been too moderate, they feel that the only way they can achieve heaven is by going out with a bang.

That's why so many terrorist attacks come from recently radicalized moderate (or lapsed) Muslims, a college age kid does some completely normal things like drinking, drugs, sex, listening to music, stop praying, basically anything enjoyable, and they realize they have a steep uphill battle to make it to heaven. Some clerics even suggest a volume of make-up prayers required, eg. skipping your prayers for a year means 1825 make up prayers (at 5 prayers per day). If they think they can't balance the books before they die, they choose martyrdom to clear their debt.

The government owns a patent on THC that is manufactured as marinol.

&gt;but saying it has no medicinal value and then getting a patent for a medicinal purpose is just cognitive dissonance.

No, because that's how it works. They're saying cannabis doesn't have medical value, but a particular component compound of it does. The component drugs get approved, not the herb or thing it's found in. Statins are derivatives from compounds in red rice. Red rice isn't recognized for medical benefits, but statins are. The only issue is why cannabis would be classified in this type of scheduling at all. It shouldn't be, but here we are.

Also, cognitive dissonance isn't holding conflicting ideas. It's a mental distress as a result from holding conflicting ideas. They can advocate for THC being a medicine yet cannabis not without having any mental distress. Without that negative cognitive feeling, it's not cognitive dissonance.",trees

It's not unlimited other than in time, and not unrestricted.  It would be their EU rights ""frozen"" at the time that the UK leaves the EU.  They wouldn't get post-Brexit ""new"" EU rights while in the UK (which is going to be damned awkward, because there's no way to revise those rights in the future, even if they wind up having problems).

I agree that this does not seem acceptable to me.  This sort of relationship with [extraterritorial jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritorial_jurisdiction) for one's citziens is not common, and one of the few times I can think of it happening was when the UK forced it upon colonial-era China.

I don't know what the EU's actual concerns are, but one thing might be an immediate post-Brexit spate of British laws ejecting recent pre-Brexit immigrants.  I think that I could see EU-UK agreement on some sort of bounds that sunset to avoid that.  If the UK is in good faith willing to commit to immigration that has already happened, then it shouldn't object to some sort of strictures there.

But simply handing authority over to the ECJ seems pretty problematic to me.  I'm hoping that the EU is treating this as an optimistic starting point, rather than a red line.",europe

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/6212bc70063b4b31b5f9cb2e1653e448.png)  

&gt; Timothy Charles Buckley III (February 14, 1947 – June 29, 1975) was an experimental vocalist and performer who incorporated jazz, psychedelia, funk, soul, and avant-garde rock, in a short career spanning the late 1960s and early 1970s, ending with his death at age 28 from an alcohol-heroin overdose.

&gt; Buckley often regarded his tenor voice as an instrument, a talent most noticeable on his albums Happy Sad, Lorca, and Starsailor. His first marriage was to Mary Guibert, with whom he had a child, musician Jeff Buckley. They divorced in 1968 and after this Buckley would meet with his son only once more. Buckley married second wife Judy Brejot Sutcliffe in 1970 and adopted her son, Taylor.

&gt; Born in Washington DC, Buckley,an Irish-American, lived for 10 years in Amsterdam, New York, before moving to southern California, initially to Bell Gardens and later settling in Anaheim in 1965. His experiences with music were through his family, artists such as Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland being particular favorites in the household. During his childhood, Buckley was a fan of Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Nat King Cole and Miles Davis, although country music was his foremost passion. Reflecting this, at the age of 11 Buckley learned how to play the banjo, an instrument which his mother had bought to occupy him following a bout of mumps. He attended Loara High School in Anaheim, California, and, amongst others, made friends with Don Gordon, Larry Beckett, Jim Fielder (original member of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears) and future wife, Mary Guibert. He was an accomplished high school athlete, becoming a quarterback for the school team in addition to getting a place on the baseball team. During this period playing as quarterback, Buckley broke the first two fingers on his left hand but they never fully returned to normal and made guitar playing more difficult. At the age of 15, Buckley abandoned the banjo and moved on to the guitar, playing with Princess Ramona &amp; The Cherokee Riders, a country and western band. However, the lead singer saw Buckley was uninterested and instead suggested he apply himself to the emerging 1960's folk scene.

&gt; Buckley's career began with his 1966 debut Tim Buckley, its mix of pop and folk rock drawing on popular influences of the time. His popularity peaked with second album Goodbye and Hello, a more mature record with avant-garde influences and political sentiments. In the three years that followed Buckley was at his most prolific and experimental, producing four albums of varying styles. Happy Sad and Blue Afternoon showed Buckley's folk roots while Lorca veered to more avant-garde styles. The final album of this period, Starsailor, is a mix of jazz, funk and avant-garde styles, representing his continual evolution in genre. This period, while garnering some critical success, proved disastrous for his record sales as the disparity of his styles caused his fan-base to all but disappear.

&gt; Following this Buckley changed genres again, with 1972 release Greetings from L.A., which incorporated the funk, rhythm and blues and soul sounds of the early 1970s in to his music. However, this release and the following album Sefronia did not match up to the success of his previous work. In 1974, having alienated much of his fan-base and squandered money made at his peak, Buckley released Look at the Fool, which was neither well received by the public nor the majority of critics. By this point Buckley had grown disillusioned with the music industry and his drug abuse of the past seven years had affected him.

&gt; In spite of this, in early 1975, desperate for musical recognition and an escape from poverty and obscurity, Buckley dropped his drug dependencies and engaged the musical press regarding a live album comeback. Buckley began performing material drawn from his whole career as a response to the desires of his audience, desires he had always spurned in the past. However, Buckley relapsed and on June 28, 1975, he overdosed on heroin. His wife Judy, having earlier put him in bed, was unable to rouse him and paramedics pronounced him dead on arrival. He was 28 years old and was survived by his wife and adopted son Taylor, and his biological son, Jeff (who also died at a young age). Read more on Last.fm.

Edit: I think to clarify my thoughts, I simply think that some of the language used here is indicative of a dependency which can be unhealthy for some. For others, it can be life saving. Regardless, by realizing that cannabis is just a substance, it empowers us to see the negatives and the positives, and decide consciously to use it.

4367,"&gt; While there is no smoking gun, there is more than enough for most sober minded and rational people to advocate an official investigation.

Ever heard of *corpus delicti*?

PG lacks the most basic of requirements: **Evidence that the crimes you are accusing them of actually occurred**

-----

[*Corpus delicti*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_delicti) or ""body of the crime"", refers to the legal concept stating that before charging a person with a crime, there has to be evidence that a crime has actually been committed.

The most literal meaning of the word would involve finding an actual ""body"" with evidence of foul play ***before*** we can charge someone with murder.

Of course a ""body"", *per se*, is not necessary. However, evidence of some kind of crime has to actually exist:

* We don't charge someone with larceny if we don't have evidence that property was stolen.

* We don't charge someone with arson if we don't have evidence that a fire was intentionally set.

* We don't charge someone with murder if we don't have evidence  that a person was murdered [(an actual ""body"" is not necessary).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_George_Haigh)

*Once evidence of a crime has surfaced, we still don't charge someone with the crime unless we have evidence tying them to that crime.*

Pizzagate ~~investigators~~ proponents have demonstrated that they are willing to lie, misrepresent evidence, or sometimes fabricate stories from whole cloth (e.g. the PG ""code words"") in order to push their narrative. As it stands, they are advocating for gross violations of our Constitutional rights:

1. First Amendment - They want people to be ""investigated"" for owning ""weird"" art

2. Fourth Amendment - They want people's homes/businesses ""investigated"" and searched before establishing evidence of a crime (i.e. *corpus delicti*)

3. Sixth Amendment - They want people to be ""investigated"" when accused by completely anonymous strangers who are not victims, witnesses, *or* under penalty of perjury

PG proponents have nothing but accusations and imagined innuendo. If the government starts ""investigating"" people based on the ""circumstantial evidence"" (I use that term *very* loosely) that PG proponents have, we have much bigger problems than imaginary Satan-worshiping pedophile boogeymen. PG is nothing more than a witch-hunt.

**TL;DR: Before investigating or charging a person with a crime, first we must ~~prove~~ have evidence that a crime has been committed, *then* we follow the evidence in order to find a suspect/s. Pizzagate has been the exact opposite: they started with suspects and are actively looking for evidence of a predetermined crime.  They want the severity of the accusation determining whether we forgo our Constitutional rights. It's the same reasoning used to justify the Patriot Act. Only instead of yelling ""Terrorist!"", Pizzagate proponents are yelling ""Child molester!""**

&gt; Rissi Palmer is an American country music singer-songwriter and musician.
Rissi Palmer was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1981. She lived in the suburb of Sewickley until moving with her family to Eureka, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, at the age of 12. Her parents were natives of Georgia. Palmer has said her mother, who died when Palmer was seven, ""was a huge Patsy Cline fan"", while her father loved musicians such as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Chaka Khan, and Santana.[3] Palmer said she knew from a young age that she wanted to sing. As a child, she sang on a Mickey Mouse Club-like local television show called Team 11. At age 16, she performed country music at the Arkansas State Fair.

&gt; When she was 19, R&amp;B producers James ""Jimmy Jam"" Harris III and Terry Lewis offered her a deal on their Flyte Tyme Records. Palmer rejected the deal because she said they wanted to turn her ""twangy"" country style into a ""pop/soul hybrid."" As she said, ""I love R&amp;B and urban music, but it wasn't what I wanted to do. I knew I wouldn't be happy doing that."" After that, Palmer sang jingles for Barbie commercials, performed on the Dance Fever television show, and competed on Star Search, all while trying in vain for seven years to land a Nashville recording contract.

&gt; In 2006, Starbucks Entertainment distributed a four-song EP that put Palmer among the top 5 best-selling country artists on iTunes. Palmer was also featured in a 2005 Country Music Television documentary about African-Americans and country music.

&gt; Palmer's debut album, Rissi Palmer, was released on October 23, 2007, by 1720 Entertainment. Palmer co-wrote nine of the 12 tracks. Read more on Last.fm.

Sample size determination is the act of choosing the number of observations or replicates to include in a statistical sample. The sample size is an important feature of any empirical study in which the goal is to make inferences about a population from a sample. In practice, the sample size used in a study is determined based on the expense of data collection, and the need to have sufficient statistical power. In complicated studies there may be several different sample sizes involved in the study: for example, in a stratified survey there would be different sample sizes for each stratum.

(h) whether the act committed was in response to a use or threat of force that the person knew was lawful.

Say he plays until 36, while a decline at 32. 

He'll hit, say, 15 more home runs this year to put home at 142. That's an average of 28 home runs per year. 28*6 years of prime left. That's 310 home runs. 

He'll drive in 60 more this year to put him at 510 RBI. 
102 per year. That means he'll have 1100 total by age 32. 

Defense will always be there. It's not out of the question for 10 career golden gloves. That's insane btw.

4 more years of 20 hr 80 RBI means about 400 home runs,  1500 RBI. He might even get 2000 hits.

She is not just fucking the MC's previous body, she is fucking herself through it via the memory double loading, its a kink, and the copy doesn't murder her, she just bursts out of sensory overload.

Then she has a whole load more shit dumped on her when she is married off to Ramsey (something that doesn't happen in the books, but it's an understandable decision to slim down the characters for the show and give Sansa something to do during that season). How much should one character have to endure, particularly sexual violence?

Secondly, the way that the scene was shot meant that we ""saw"" it through Theon's eyes and the rape was used as a form of torture against him. So not only does Sansa lose her agency through the rape, she is also being used passively as a weapon against another man.

There are so many other reasons you could use that don't rely on the Giants having no run game or red zone threats outside of Odell for most of his career. I truly believe it's probably the most overrated stat in football. It's not so much that being able to score in the red zone isn't a skill, but you're almost completely up to the mercy of play calling. Like in 2012, Megatron had 6 TDs. In probably the best season a WRs ever had. And he's probably one of the best red zone threats of all time.

It would have been much nicer had they not increased the scaling of dungeons from 8% to 10%, because people would have settled on doing the difficulty relevant to themselves, anyway (only, the reward would have actually matched the difficulty - with the current curve, you want to be well over 910 ilvl to *farm* 15s). Essentially what I'm saying is: the curve should be at a point where a player that is capable of doing a 23 in time (6x pieces of loot) should prefer that over doing 2 15s in time (also 6x pieces of loot).

Of course, an alternative could also be to have a much higher loot curve that more closely matches the added difficulty - even something like 0.5 pieces per level over 15, and 1 piece per level over 20, would greatly encourage pushing to the highest your group can do in time.

Is Sammy Baugh or Otto Graham the best QB ever if you use the same cross-time analysis because I tend to think in those types of examples, Sammy Baugh would be off the charts.

5217,"I think the problem with this lore is that it doesn't really expand on Kayn outside of what we already gathered about him.

We we're basically told from this lore is that:

* Kayn is cocky and arrogant 

* Kayn is very good at combat

* Kayn isn't too fond of Noxus

* Raast corrupts those that wield him

This is all stuff we pretty much already knew and gathered from his reveal and VO. Anything else like the different aspects of Kayn's personality or Raast aren't expanded upon what we already know. 

In fact the most surprising thing we learn from this is that Kayn is from Noxus. But like, it isn't even a big deal. I think it would have been kinda cool if Kayn had more sympathy to Noxians or was more reluctant to kill them, but since Noxus treats him like shit (Because everyone that lives in Noxus is satan for some reason) he hates their guts, same as any other Ionian. If he has no particular ties to Noxus and has the same attitude to Noxus as he would as an Ionian, then what's the point of making him Noxian?

I'm also not massively fond of the whole ""Champions using abilities in their lore"" thing shown here. Yeah it's cool for a champion's lore to have a few nods at their gameplay, but having Kayn's E and Ult described in detail in a story is just.....a little off.

I'm not even really upset about his lore being edgy. Like, Kayn's edgy to the point that it's almost charming. But like, you couldn't have shown a little variance to his character in the lore? Bit of a shame",leagueoflegends

I can agree that his style tends to be more casual and his remarks sometimes a bit unpolished or overly rigid in delivery. He could have left more breathing room in his judgment of Aphromoo. Those are fair points. I do however think that it's a high expectation to have, or a tough line to walk, between being blunt and straightforward with one's rhetoric and also being reserved enough to allow for other possible interpretations of an action. Perhaps what makes it jarring is that one expects authoritative statements from a color caster, and not from a PBP. It could actually be a good point that as a PBP Phreak would be better served erring on the side of less forceful rhetoric when he makes an analytical comment. It's something I'd have to think about more.

Comparing apples and oranges. Your outrage shows a crucial misunderstanding about how game development works on consoles.

Certification can take quite a while depending on variables that isn't too clear to the general public. It will take too long on consoles to get the amount of updates that the PTR receives to be worth the effort. By the time certification clears the changes on PTR could already have been on live servers.

Note that when I say ""upper caste"" I don't specifically mean Brahmins, I include all savarna castes. [Here](https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Papers/hm.pdf) is an excellent, widely cited economic analysis of Hindu-Muslim conflict in India that points to increasing economic viability of Muslims as a primary cause for violence instigated by economically dominant Hindus - this, whilst primarily a response to economic competition, makes it very easy for Hindus to form lynch mobs with religion as an excuse. [This](http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1271&amp;context=facsch_papers) is another fascinating paper that describes the change in Hindu attitudes towards Syrian Christians when lower castes began converting to Christianity, ""polluting"" (according to them) the originally ""pure"" Syrian Christian community, increasing Hindu-Christian violence.

If anecdotal evidence is also okay - almost all religious violence in Maharashtra (my state) has been instigated - by literal calls for war against Muslims - by middle-/upper-caste actors like the Shiv Sena (who have also historically been anti-immigration ""activists""/mobs).

...however, I've been pondering as to why the films have not felt nearly as memorable as long-lasting as something like LOTR or Star Wars or Toy Story or even Harry Potter. I mean, the films don't do that much wrong--yeah, there are flaws here and there but they're just extremely solid on most fronts.

But what I've kind of realized is that while the films are extremely well made and directed...that's all they seem to be. They're extremely solid all around, but hardly ever take the moment to make you say, ""...Wow."" They don't take the opportunities to go beyond the story told and blow your mind for a moment. The closest we ever got to it was in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, when Caesar first shouts out, ""**NO!**""

So yeah, solid all around. And extremely consistent. But never taking the time to go beyond that.

&gt; The Pretenders is an English-American rock band founded in Hereford, United Kingdom that came to prominence during the punk and new wave movement of the late 1970s due to their innovative songwriting and charismatic performances. Since then, the band has experienced drug-related losses and numerous subsequent personnel changes, with American-born group founder, songwriter, vocalist, and rhythm guitarist Chrissie Hynde as the only consistent member.

&gt; Formed in 1978 in London, the original band Hynde, lead and rhythm guitarist James Honeyman-Scott (died 1982), bassist Pete Farndon (died 1983), and drummer Martin Chambers. Save for Hynde, a native of Akron, Ohio, the original band members were all from the U.K. This band was fractured by the drug-related deaths of Honeyman-Scott  and Farndon. Since then, numerous subsequent personnel changes have taken place over the years, with Hynde as the sole constant. 

&gt; With Hynde at the helm, the band experienced a critical resurgence with a trio of albums released between the mid-90s and early 00s that explored a more mature side of the band’s classic sound.

&gt; In 2008, the Pretenders' album Break Up the Concrete was released through Shangri-La Music. It was the band's first Top 40 album in the US in 22 years.

&gt; In September 2012, as part of the entertainment line-up for the 2012 Singapore Grand Prix, the Pretenders re-grouped with Hynde and Chambers from the original line-up, along with Nick Wilkinson, James Walbourne and Eric Heywood. Read more on Last.fm.

FYI, 230k with a vairable rate 30yr mortgage (2.3%) comes in dirt cheap with 10% down.  You're talking $964/mo.   Plus condo fees and taxes.   

In the first year of that mortgage alone you've paid down 6.5k of that mortgage and only paid 4k in interest.

Think of it like renting money.   That 964/mo mortgage is really costing you 400/mo because you're paying the rest to yourself.    Just add in the condo fees and property taxes, and you're probably looking to about what the rental market is worth for that place.

5451,"Seems that Twisted Blood has already argued in defence of his own article, but I'll just add some thoughts.

I am very rarely excited by La Liga fixtures that involve Barcelona. The whole reason the Clasicos are hyped to the extent they are is because Barcelona are forced to face an opponent which is meant to be able to challenge them. But tuning into a fixture like Barca vs Sporting is almost always dull in the context of a competitive match - Barca will dominate possession, their opponent will almost invariably sit back, and eventually Barcelona will win. It's practically an inevitability at this point that Barcelona will win. That is not to say I don't admire their play, it's often breath-taking, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy it. 

Essentially, for most parts of the game, I believe Barca simply perform the ""sterile domination"" that Wenger describes that makes matches they are involved in very hard to enjoy in a competitive sense. The way Twisted Blood described and rationalised these feelings are what drawed me to the article. ",soccer

This principle/law is one of the things which makes particle physics so difficult.

The more you know about the particle's position, the less you know about its momentum, and vice-versa.

5581,"Has RBI honoured its foreign-takeover commitments?
Before Burger King took over Tim Hortons in late 2014, it pledged to the federal government that it would expand Tim’s outside of Canada, keep existing employment levels at franchises, and maintain the company’s headquarters in Oakville, Ontario. It also promised, vaguely, to maintain “significant” employment levels at HQ. A spokesman for former industry minister James Moore, who approved the takeover, said in 2015 that Tim Hortons could not lay off more than 20% of head office and regional staff. Tim’s noted in January, 2015, that it had shed 350 employees, including those at distribution centres, keeping it within the 20% range. It would not provide updated figures. A federal freedom-of-information request failed to produce further details.
Burger King also agreed that the board of the Tim Hortons brand would be 50% Canadian. That board refers to TDL Group Corp. of Vancouver, the wholly owned RBI subsidiary that technically operates the Tim’s brand in Canada. TDL shares an address with law firm Lawson Lundell LLP. Two of TDL’s four board members are Canadian, including RBI’s chief corporate affairs officer, Patrick McGrade.
Meanwhile, it seems the real power is in the hands of RBI—and only three of its 12 board members are Canadian.
Back in the comforting hubbub of Tim Hortons coffee shops across the country, not much has changed—yet. Timmy’s still attracts a diverse cross-section of Canadians, from students and hipsters to senior citizens and new immigrants. It’s still seen as a safe and comforting place to stop during road trips, and a great place to take the kids for a hot chocolate after skating.


For all its successes, RBI has not yet demonstrated that it knows how to nurture a brand. Its other main holding, Burger King, could take lessons from Timmy’s, not the other way around. But brands are durable—Tim’s has built up many decades of goodwill—and it will be a while before that lost connection shows up in the bottom line.

If that happens, and Tim Hortons becomes just another faceless—albeit highly efficient—coffee chain, 3G will have changed forever one of this country’s most beloved brands.

“There’s no one big thing that’s going to weaken them,” says Middleton. “The danger with a strong brand faced with this kind of change is that you die the death of a thousand small cuts.” ",canada

I'm 33 &amp; had a net connected PC in the United Kingdom prob 3 to 4 years before the trend started to even catch on let alone every household have at lest one computer. This was 1996/97.

I recently split from a relationship where it was just fun (age doesn't matter). She was 19. So i would have hung-out with her circle of friends quite often.

What struck me was that to them i was some sort of 'Computer Ninja'. I consider myself the typical reddit---er with what i consider intermediate skills - The Norm.

Firefox/extensions; userscripts &amp; userstyles. Jailbreaking iPhones; basic understanding of html/css/javascript. Anyway... You get me.

So what struck me was. The younger generation have grown up with this. Its meant to be 2nd nature. But to most of that age group i knew. It was not.

At 1st I thought if this is the dumb-ed down hope for the future. Then all hope is lost.

They only take stuff down if certain legal action is under way (under the DCMA act, you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want, as long as you comply with cease and desist letters). It's like YouTube, only companies aren't that afraid of Grooveshark (yet), and they struggle to keep up with the amount of uploading done.

Artists suffer from this. Grooveshark is basically forcing them (or rather, their labels; if you're a lone artist you can basically just go fuck yourself) to either (potentially) spend a lot of money going against the service, legally, or ""joining them"", giving them (and their users) permission to spread their music (including horrible versions that users upload); and right now, they're using pretty much all their income just to cover legal actions and the expenses of royalties to the bigger labels that has already sued them.

Not to mention that to get royalties, services needs to cooperate with certain instances (where you and the service register, so that money can exchange hands), and as far as I know, Grooveshark aren't the best at keeping those records up to date, either.

I read a post right here on Reddit a couple of months back, made by an artist that didn't get any money from Grooveshark, and the consensus was pretty much: ""Oh, yeah, they just don't do that"".

To be fair, it looks like they're going the way of Spotify, trying to boost their income, so that they, at some point in the future, will be a service that actually has some merit, but right now, their whole business model is that they have no business model. Their money is in court; and they seem to not really care that that money isn't going to their rightful owners, but are instead going to the defence of a ludicrous service that didn't have a plan, or indeed any intention, of paying the people responsible for their livelihood.",Music

5770,"&gt; But I'm honestly not underestimating the complexity of CSGO, it's just not as complex as Dota2. Jiggle-peeking, spray control (which sadly still slightly depend on RNG), nade usage, game strategy and that's all. The game mainly revolves around the players and the players only.

I just think that both teamplay and a PvP environment both add so much complexity to a game that any extra layers are just ""fluff"". The real trick to playing at the top level is to be able to be one step ahead of your opponent. That's a lot harder to do when everyone has mastered the same basic principles in my opinion.

I do understand that ingenuity plays an important part in MOBA games and this is indeed something I also like to see. I just think that it's a lot harder to be inventive in a limited environment than it is in an constantly changing environment that is flooded with unnecessary rulesets. That's basically what champion skills and items are, part of the ruleset implemented by the dev.

So in a way, MOBA games are competitive in a different way. It's more about finding out how to get the maximum out of a ruleset. I get why some people enjoy that, I just prefer competition on an even playing field when it comes to PvP. It's different when it comes to PvE. I love games that challenge you to use your ingenuity to conquer its limitations. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy watching MOBA games.

I'd probably enjoy it more if every skill was a skillshot and if everything could be dodged. That would be a great compromise in my opinion. Give the same velocity for every champion and skill. At this point in time in LoL for example, some champions aren't seeing any play because they have skillshots while others are a lot easier to play effectively. That's not my idea of a proper competitive game. I still enjoy watching it, I just wouldn't play it.

&gt; P.S. I don't think GO and Chess are ""difficult"" games, there's a reason why Google's AI won against the no. 1 player. 

I don't think that argument holds up though. You could get a computer or a machine to do the same for every sport out there. That's what machines are for, we built them to do what we could not. Whatever a machine can't do, isn't the failure of the machine, it's the failure of those who constructed it.",GlobalOffensive

Not really. Ranking players in League is a lot less subjective than art criticism. Stats in League matter way more than whether or not the drum and guitar are perfectly timed in a song. There is also way more objective information available for analysis in League.

[British court decision](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2017/972.html)  


&gt;126.Very sadly in Charlie's case there is a consensus across the board, including from his parents, that Charlie's current quality of life is not one that should be sustained without hope of improvement

&gt;127.[...] nucleoside therapy has not even been tried on a mouse model.[...]

&gt;91.I gave the parents permission to instruct their own expert. Accordingly, the parents instructed Dr. L [, who] concluded his report by saying that ""The nature of Charlie's condition means that he is likely to continue to deteriorate, that he is likely to remain immobile, that he will exhibit severe cognitive impairment, that he will remain dependent on ventilatory support to maintain respiration, will continue to need to be tube fed and that he will always be dependent on mechanical ventilation to maintain life.""

5950,"This is just a bad article.

Among the points that the author makes is that Curry is taking a vastly different approach in taking the max, while Durant is giving back.

Just looking at the real numbers though, the two are on a remarkably similar curve.

Through 8 years, Steph has made $56 million in salary.
Through 8 years, Durant had made $86 million.

Through 10 years, Steph will be at around $127 million.
Through 10 years, Durant has made $132 million.

They will basically have been paid the same amount of money. Sure, Steph is going to end up with a few million more by the time they get to their 12th year, but that assumes KD doesn't opt out next year and get more.

This is pretty much expected - Curry is younger, salaries are on the rise, you'd expect him to make a bit more over his career just on that basis alone.

It also ignores the real situations that were present when their contracts were signed. Curry had injury concerns and hadn't reached MVP level when he signed his last deal.

Meanwhile Durant is making considerations for competitive reasons AND the contracts were signed under a completely different CBA.

So it's kind of ridiculous to compare the two deals and make any judgements about either of their motivations as compared to the other.

Calling KD a more selfless player or person than Steph is stupid. You only need to watch them play to see that they are both selfless guys who put the team ahead of themselves.  

But even if you do insist on comparing the two, in terms of what they are actually getting paid for their services, they are almost identical.",nba

And I'm also allowed to disagree with you. 

I probably wouldn't take Ingram top 5 in this draft. Specifically, I think Tatum and Isaac were both significantly better at draft time than Ingram was last year - both are better shooters, and Isaac specifically has incredible defensive upside. 

In terms of Lonzo - I disagree with your framing of his elite skills. I think in order to be a transcendent talent, you have to have an outlier skill at *something*. Lonzo has a clear path to being an all time great at both decision making and passing. Those are very valuable skills in any era - this isn't an Okafor/Tatum situation where they are elite at creating inefficient shots. I don't think many prospects in recent years have had this clear of a path to being an all time great at a valuable skill. 

I also think he can be a great scorer (elite TS% in college from all parts of the floor), a good defender (size, athleticism, instincts) and just an overall leader and franchise player - he has that ""it"" factor to me. To me, more than enough signs to think he *could* become a transcendent player. ",

6136,"I don't know the future, but crimes do not exist in a vacuum, take theft, there's theft because someone does not have something that another has, if that something was widely available theft would disappear and thus no need for explicitly forbidding it. Even rape is about power and control, probably because they lack it in their own lives (I admit I'm speculating a bit here), but the point is that rape itself has social motives behind it that can disappear if we know them and act accordingly.

Primitive societies were egalitarian, classless and did not have laws. Again, I don't know the future, but what's important is to realize that conditions change people and people change conditions, that nothing is eternal or innate, it can be addressed outside laws, law is the refugee of the scoundrel. Which is why debating about legality of drugs etc is only a part of the problem at hand, making it illegal solves nothing, what is more important is to understand why people do drugs and address those social issues. (And guess what, as usual it's the same shit, alienation, lack of control in life etc, issues common under class societies).

Which is also why political correctness does not work and it pisses me off leftists that support it, PC masks the issues instead of confronting them, forbidding racists or sexists jokes won't stop racism and sexism, it's much more important to understand racism and sexism and do something about it, of course you won't like my answer, it is, once more, tied to capitalism, racism was born out of the need for economical exploitation (racism was created as a justification for the act of enslaving people).

6170,"&gt; My impression is that nominal GDP is more useful when agreeing to trade talks.

That's because international trade usually happens in just one currency, either US dollars or euros and because prices are always negotiated and influenced by trade deals.

&gt; USA won't really lower the price of those F-16's just because

the US is the only country who makes F-16s. This is their leverage for keeping the price high.

Even so, the price still varies depending on trade deals or military/political alliances.

If the US wants to build a missile defense system in Romania and Romania wants to buy some tanks from the US, the US might be convinced to offer a discount.

These, however, are very specific commodities that are sold via other rules than basic commodities such as oranges.

Most international trade revolves around basic commodities.

&gt; However, the same doesn't work for PC parts or similar.

Yep. Why? Because they are not basic commodities and not all countries produce them.

That's why prices are roughly the same. Because they are dictated by a small number of companies that produce them.

&gt; Like, I'm a trader looking to export stuff to all sorts of countries. Isn't it more sensible to look at their average wages in dollars/nominal GDP per capita?

Yes, but your goal here isn't trying to compare the economy of this country to the economy of another. Your goal is profit. Your goal here is trying to find the best price that will sell the most units while also making you the most overall profit.

&gt; I care to make as much money as I can, and so then why would I want to lower my prices to the point they're affordable to whatever poorer country?

Because a smaller profit is better than no profit at all.

If the price is too high, people can't afford to buy your product. That means you'll be making zero profit while your competitors will be expanding and selling at PPP adjusted prices so that they can keep expanding in other countries in order to make even more profit.",europe

6277,"&gt; what led Norway to be a founding member?

Primarily, the loss of sovereignty. Nazi Germany's invasion and occupation revealed the apparent uselessness of being neutral. The rules had changed. Furthermore, we saw a clear need to join together with our closest friends and allies (the UK, US, Europe) for continued support. As a small nation we could not hope to withstand the USSR or Germany again.

Especially, in light of the potential threat of communist invasion/insurrection. Our Parliament, the Norwegian Labor party (social-democrats), the armed forces and intelligence agency, all saw a need to defend the country against communism. 

The West used NATO for cooperation to prepare for conflict and prevent communist funded rebellions/revolutions.

&gt;  Is Norway not happy about that? 

We're pretty happy about that. We view the US very positively in this context (reliable partner). Which is why Norway is always willing to support our allies when called for (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, etc). Very few dissidents, but some on the left wing of politics. 

&gt; without all the communism

Before and after WWII it was a different situation. The Labor party had ruled Norway for a long time. Within that party there were divisions; deep reds such as Communists, Marxists, M-Ls, etc. The Norwegian communists were in communication with the USSR. The USSR had lots of active agents here. Remember, after WWII the communists stood strong in many countries; they looked good to many people. They won the war, and people were looking for easy solutions and hope. With some support from the USSR they could have taken the country further left, with or without violence. Maybe they could have won the popular vote even.",europe

So let's summarize your views.  You believe there was a conspiracy with Putin to lift sanctions for help with the election.  So in theory, him lifting the sanctions should be evidence that the conspiracy is correct.  Since this hasn't happened yet, you've decided to move the goal posts back and declare that if he doesn't issues *new* sanctions, then that is evidence that the conspiracy about lifting the old sanctions is correct.   
  
This is like claiming that a governor made a deal with a wealthy inmate to pardon him in exchange for monetary campaign support and then when it doesn't happen, declare that if the governor doesn't add additional years to the inmates sentence, it's evidence that he really did make the original pardon deal.

Moreover Tunisia is the only muslim country which tuned up better after the Arab Spring, it is trying to be demoratic and secular, and the EU should help it as much as it can in its development. The only reasonable agreement in the migrant crisis that is possible between the EU and Tunisia, which would be in the interest of both countries, is to turn the boats with migrants back to Tunisia if they departed from the Tunisian shore in the first place. The same would be valid for other countries: if the boats come from Lybia - turn them back to Lybia, if they come from Egypt - back to Egypt, etc. This solution is fairer for the countries of North Africa, plus this would remove the incentive for the migrants to flood these countries on their way to Europe. I don't think the local NA population is going to accept the current situation much longer, after all, they risk the appearance of an European Trump who will simply stop rescuing the boats and by that time millions of Subsaharan Africans and not only will be stranded there, causing the locals' fury who will then blame their governments for it.

6319,"Low-fat foods tend to be very high in sugars, which are increased to compensate for the loss of flavor, and to be just as caloric as their ""high fat"" counterparts.

Here's a very basic outline of why this is bad, based on what we *think* we know today. While high in calories, fat in and of itself seems to be almost totally innocent in the case of both obesity and metabolic syndrome more generally. Taking in your calories as fat results in a more stable blood sugar and thus lower levels of insulin (and insulin resistance as well). Taking in calories as carbohydrates, especially refined sugar, results in extreme swings in blood sugar - large amounts of insulin are secreted to control this. Among other functions, insulin strongly promotes *fat storage* and in a more general sense, *growth*. Thus circulating blood sugar is stored as fat, and the process continues. Stored central fat (belly fat) modifies the metabolism further by producing large of amounts of fat-storage promoting hormones itself - some have likened large amounts of belly fat to a disruptive extra endocrine organ. Moral of the story: return healthy and ""natural"" fats to your diet, reduce your refined sugar and general carbohydrate intake as much as possible (with the exception of vegetables)",

There's no historical evidence of that. The idea that Jews aren't just another Cnaanite nation is considered a Babylonian-exile-era myth, that is, when the Jews were in exile in modern-day Iraq. But if you want to go by the Bible, sure - but then you also have to concede that Jews have a God-given right to the land :)

&gt; What you are alluding to is simply revisionist history which was invented by Zionist ideologues in the 19th century.

This is, I'm afraid, completely untrue. Whatever your personal opinions about the Jews might be, the idea that they are a separate ethnic group, and the cultural descendants of the ancient Hebrews *is the classical, ancient idea*, believed by everyone, Jew or Gentile, for thousands of years before the invention of Zionism.

The idea that the Palestinians are actually Arabized Jews is, however, a very new revisionist idea, mostly popular in the loony fringes of the Israeli right and left wing. The fact you read it in a highly controversial conspiracy-theory book (completely discredited by actual scholars and DNA evidence, if one to believe the Wikipedia article), rather than a mainstream history book, should've been a warning sign.

Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas (both critically endangered), and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95–99% depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.

**Guerrilla warfare**

Guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which a small group of combatants such as paramilitary personnel, armed civilians, or irregulars use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and mobility to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military.

I'm writing this here because I just need to vent a bit.

The anime fails badly at making a believable world. There are samurai who have made their bodies into bulky machines for more strength yet they fall like flies to the normal samurai.

The samurai are capable of increadible feats of strength but there is no explanation for how they do this and it is really inconsistent.
They break the laws of physics with no explanations.
[Samurai 7 spoilers](/s ""One of them goes from being useless to being almost able to fly over the course of a few battles. He later deflects a laser beam with his sword, he just pulled that trick out of his ass.

6507,"&gt;Remain is now the dominating voting position and will only strengthen as the old who voted for it die off.

Which polls are you looking at?  The last one I've seen posted to this sub had the levels of support rock-solid post-Brexit. There was no greater enthusiasm or regret, and my guess is that very few Britons are changing their mind one way or the other.

I agree with the age thing, based on some EU perceptions polling the EU did — the UK was shifting towards EU support, but it was a *very* slow process compared to other EU members.  However, I'm also somewhat suspicious that this is preference for ""what you grew up with"".  Having the UK out of the EU might also cause that to be the norm, and the country to increasingly not want to join.

We've been next to Canada for a long time, have the longest border in the world, do a ton of trade, same language, have pretty interchangeable product standards, similar sets of no-visa agreements (Mexico and soon Romania-Poland-Bulgaria to be notable exceptions) — but Canada hasn't asked to be one country with the US, or visa versa.  Instead, we just collaborate on a bunch of things, do joint military things, etc.  I could very easily see the UK and the EU doing the same thing.

If the UK becomes an EU member again, my bet will be that it will be at least a couple of decades down the road, after economic convergence in the EU — that'd cause less of a rush of immigration into the UK.  Further, any deal that the UK would be offered will *probably* be less-favorable than the one it has now — I doubt the opt-outs will be on offer.  That'll presumably produce less support.

The EU does do a lot of programs that permit for *a la carte* affiliation with the EU, like Schengen, and if that continues, I could see the UK joining those without necessarily joining the EU.",

I'm a current student at my state's largest four-year University. On day one I had to watch videos about affirmative consent and everyone that spoke to the students introduced themselves with their preferred pronouns despite obviously being cis-gendered.

When Milo Yiannopoulos came to speak, the school tried to create last minute ""security fees"" to prevent him from speaking. The only reason he was able to was because liberal groups in the school doxxed the head of the Republican school group and their parents, resulting in enough controversy that a funding drive was created by local conservative groups that allowed for them to cover the school's security fees.

During the talk, everyone who came to see Milo had to be escorted out through the building's parking garage because the building had become surrounded by an angry mob calling everyone Nazi's, waiting with weapons to assault anyone who left the building.

This is after someone waiting in line defended her husband by shooting one of the rioters who were attacking her husband because he was wearing a hat they disapproved of.

Think about it:  In T1 and T2, Judgement Day happens in 1997.  Assuming John is born in 1985, he'd only be 12 when J-Day happens.  But because of the events in T2 (which happens in 1995 when he's 10) , it's postponed until 2003, when he's 18.  Yes, I know, the numbers don't quite work out , but the main point is that they guided events and created a destiny more favorable.  John is older, and while people might follow a man of 18+ years old, no one is going to follow a boy of 12.

After all, death itself contradicts the ""no fate but what we make"" platitude itself.  We are all destined to die someday, but we certainly have control over the events before that happens.  And so it is with the Terminator series:  Judgement Day has to be inevitable (or no Terminators), but how we get there is important.

So usually people will start Buffs or Raptors, in which case you usually have 2-3 ideal routes from there and warding Raptors early will telegraph how the enemy jungler will move. If people start on Raptors the route tends to go either Raptors into first buff and then going either into invade or finishing their clear towards the second buff in which case that side of the map is where you need to be focused(or you could make a couterplay on the other side of the map). They could also skip some jungle camps for an early gank so each time a jungler shows himself on the map a play needs to be done either where he shows himself or on the opposite side of the map(counterjungle his camps  that are still up or gank the opposing side of the map). Knowing that there are 22 creeps in total in each side of the jungle makes it easier to track what camps the jungler did. There are 5 creeps on the blue buff side and 17 on the red buff side(raptors are 6,Red is 1, and full Krugs are 10).

&gt; Soft Cell are an electronic music duo that came to prominence in the early 80s. They consist of vocalist Marc Almond and instrumentalist David Ball. The duo is most widely known for their 1981 worldwide hit version of ""Tainted Love"" and influential multi-platinum debut ''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret''. In the UK, they had five Top 5 hits, including ""Bedsitter"", ""Say Hello, Wave Goodbye"", ""Torch"" and ""What!"", and also had four Top 20 albums between 1981 and 1984. The duo split in 1984, but reformed in the early 2000s to tour and released a new album in 2002. Their songs have been covered by various artists including David Gray, Marilyn Manson, Nouvelle Vague and A-ha. 

&gt; Both Marc Almond and Dave Ball grew up in seaside towns (the former, Southport, and the latter, Blackpool), and later met while students at the Leeds Polytechnic Fine Arts University (now Leeds Metropolitan University). Almond, a performance artist, collaborated with Ball on a few avant-garde multi-media performances at the university. Although Ball's musical background consisted of guitar, he had access to the university studio and was experimenting with the nascent synthesizer technology at the time. The two students became the prototypical synth duo and were initially associated with other New Wave scenesters dubbed ""New Romantics"" by the British Press. Other bands associated with this scene included Visage, Duran Duran, and Spandau Ballet.

&gt; Marc Almond had a productive career as a solo artist later in the 80s and 90s and with Marc &amp; the Mambas and other collaborations. Dave Ball has done a few solo productions with other British new wave acts in the early 80s. He also later was involved in the electronic dance act The Grid with Richard Norris.

&gt; Almond and Ball's reunion as Soft Cell became official with well-received initial concerts - they performed at the opening of the Ocean nightclub in London in March 2001 to strong reviews, and a mini tour followed later in the year. The track ""God Shaped Hole"" featured on the Some Bizzare compilation titled ""I'd Rather Shout at a Returning Echo than Kid Someone's Listening"", released in 2001. The album Cruelty Without Beauty was released in late 2002, followed by a European tour and a partial US tour in early 2003. The new album featured their first new songs together in almost twenty years. One of those songs was their 2003 single ""The Night"" (UK #39). Interestingly, Soft Cell had considered recording ""The Night"" in place of ""Tainted Love"" back in 1981 as their last-ditch attempt to score a chart hit. In a 2003 interview with BBC's Top of the Pops, keyboardist David Ball asserted, ""I think history has kind of shown that we did make the right choice [in 1981].""

&gt; In August 2007, the band announced they were working on a remix album, ""Heat - The Remixes"". The remix album is expected to be released in May 2008 and will include classic Soft Cell tracks remixed by such acts as Manhattan Clique, Cicada, Richard X, Ladytron, MHC, Mark Moore, Kinky Roland, Spektrum, George Demure, Yer Man and many more.

6643,"I thought it was terrible because it looked like they reused the cgi assets from that terrible Adam Sandler movie. The fact that that idea, and the eventual filmed and edited scene, made it into the final cut without anyone saying,""hey guys this is going to remind everyone of that shit movie 'Pixels,'"" is mind boggling to me.
